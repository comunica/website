These statistics cover aspects such as the number of intermediate results, discovered links, and dereferenced links. Note that this behavior is disabled by default; enabling it requires configuration steps described in the following sections.</p>
<p>As the query executes, Comunica <strong>emits these metrics in real time</strong>, enabling other (future) Comunica actors to adaptively optimize query processing.<br/>
After query completion, these statistics can be analyzed to gain insights into execution behavior and performance characteristics. The available types of statistics are described in more detail below.</p>
<h2 id="link-discovery-and-dereference-events">Link Discovery and Dereference Events</h2>
<p>Comunica automatically tracks <strong>link discovery</strong> and <strong>link dereference</strong> events when <code>StatisticLinkDiscovery</code> and <code>StatisticLinkDereference</code> instances are added to the context under the appropriate key.<br/>
This key is defined as the statistic class attribute <code>.key</code>.</p>
<p>When querying from a JavaScript application, statistics tracking can be enabled as follows:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { QueryEngine } from &#x27;@comunica/query-sparql&#x27;;
import { StatisticLinkDereference } from &quot;@comunica/statistic-link-dereference&quot;;
import { ILink, QueryStringContext } from &#x27;@comunica/types&#x27;;

const engine = new QueryEngine();
const query = `SELECT * WHERE {
  ?s ?p ?o.
}
LIMIT 1000`;

const context: QueryStringContext = { sources: [&quot;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en&quot;] };
const statisticLinkDereference = new StatisticLinkDereference();
context[statisticLinkDereference.key.name] = statisticLinkDereference;

const bindingsStream = await engine.queryBindings(query, context);
await bindingsStream.toArray();

</code></pre></pre>
<p>These statistic trackers act as event emitters, enabling other processes to listen and react to emitted events.</p>
<h3 id="statisticlinkdiscovery">StatisticLinkDiscovery</h3>
<p>This tracker emits an arc representing a link discovery, where the parent is the URI of the document from which a new child URI is discovered.
This is particularly useful in link traversal scenarios, where many such links are followed during query execution.</p>
<p>For each discovered link, the tracker emits metadata for both the parent and child. Since the same URI can be discovered multiple times from different sources, the metadata is structured as a list of records. Each metadata record includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>discoveredTimestamp</code>: The timestamp when the URI was discovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>discoverOrder</code>: A numeric value indicating the discovery order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optionally) additional metadata associated with the link, as generated by the engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statisticlinkdereference">StatisticLinkDereference</h3>
<p>This tracker emits an event whenever a link is dereferenced by the engine. The emitted data follows the <code>ILink</code> interface and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>url</code>: The dereferenced URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>context</code> and <code>transform</code>: Link information provided via the ILink interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>metadata</code>: Metadata, which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>type</code>: The type of source class used by Comunica.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dereferencedTimestamp</code>: The timestamp when the dereference occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dereferenceOrder</code>: A numeric value indicating the dereference order, analogous to order in StatisticLinkDiscovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optionally) additional metadata associated with the link, as generated by the engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-use-case">Example Use Case</h3>
<p>These trackers can be used, for instance, to monitor what pages of a triple pattern fragment source are dereferenced and at what timestamps.</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">
const dereferencedUris: string[] = [];
const timestamps: number[] = [];

statisticLinkDereference.on((data: ILink) =&gt; {
    dereferencedUris.push(data.url);
    timestamps.push(data.metadata!.dereferencedTimestamp)
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Other Comunica actors can access the statistic tracker objects by retrieving it from the context.</p>
<h3 id="command-line">Command Line</h3>
<p>Comunica does not natively support statistic tracking from the command line.<br/>
However, it would be easy to add it to the context using an actor subscribing to the <code>bus-context-preprocess</code>.<br/>
The implementation would be similar to the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-context-preprocess-set-defaults"><code>@comunica/actor-context-preprocess-set-defaults</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="intermediate-result-events">Intermediate Result Events</h2>
<p>Tracking intermediate results follows a similar approach to the other statistics, but it requires a <a href="https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/">custom configuration</a> with additional setup steps.<br/>
Intermediate result events are captured by wrapping the <code>query-operation</code> and <code>rdf-join</code> streams with a callback.<br/>
This wrapping is performed by actors subscribing to the <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-iterator-transform"><code>@comunica/bus-iterator-transform</code></a> bus, which allows multiple wraps of a single stream.</p>

focuses more on internal changes, with limited changes to the external API.\nMost of the changes relate to the handling of data sources during query planning,\nwhich allows **more efficient query plans to be produced when querying over federations of heterogeneous sources**.\nThis means that for people using Comunica, the number of breaking changes in this update are very limited.\nThings will simplify be faster in general, and some small convenience features have been added,\nsuch as results being [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols). \nTo developers extending Comunica with custom actors, there will be some larger breaking changes.\n\n"},"/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/":{"title":"Release 3.1: 🌱 New package with tiny bundle size","excerpt":"\nThe primary addition in this release is the

this package is 648,88 KB (145,79 KB when gzipped).\nThis is about as small as you can get without removing required functionality from the SPARQL 1.1 spec\nBut if you don't need everything from

several performance improvements that were identified following these changes.\n\n"},"/blog/2024-10-15-release_4_0/":{"title":"Release 4.0: 🚄 Faster actor testing and modularized

features.\nSince then, we had several minor releases introducing multiple additions and performance improvements.\nIn [release 3.2](/blog/2024-07-05-release_3_2/), we introduced better techniques for discovering performance bottleneck.\nThis allowed us identify some low-level bottlenecks in the internals of Comunica which limited performance.\nFixing these issues requires breaking changes to the internal API of Comunica,\nwhich is the main reason for this major update.\nAs a result of these changes, we see **performance improvements of 20% to 40%**.\nBreaking changes are limited to internal Comunica APIs.\nThis means that developers that make use of Comunica can have their cake _and_ eat it 🎂;\nno breaking changes _and_ gaining a performance boost.\n\n"},"/blog/2025-04-29-release_4_2/":{"title":"Release 4.2: 🍇 Towards real-world federation improvements","excerpt":"\nIn this release, we mainly focused on taking steps towards solving
