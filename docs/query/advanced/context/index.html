you can pass additional information to the engine using a <strong>context</strong> object.</p>
<h2 id="1--how-to-use-the-context">1. How to use the context</h2>
<p>When <a href="/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/">querying in a JavaScript application</a>,
the context must be passed as second argument to the <code>query()</code> method of a Comunica engine.</p>
<p>For example, a context that defines the <code>sources</code> to query over is passed as follows:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const QueryEngine = require(&#x27;@comunica/query-sparql&#x27;).QueryEngine;
const myEngine = new QueryEngine();

const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>sources</code> field is the only entry that is required in the context.
All other entries that are discussed hereafter are optional.</p>
<div class="note">
During query execution, the context is converted into an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable">immutable</a> object
to ensure that the original context entries remain unchanged during the whole query execution.
</div>
<h2 id="2--overview">2. Overview</h2>
<p>The following table gives an overview of all possible context entries that can be passed.</p>

<p>When developing Comunica modules, all context entry keys can be found in <a href="https://comunica.github.io/comunica/modules/_comunica_context_entries.html"><code>@comunica/context-entries</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="3--defining-sources">3. Defining sources</h2>
<p>Using the <code>sources</code> context entry, data sources can be defined that Comunica should query over.
The value of this must be an array, where the array may contain both strings or objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Array elements that are strings are interpreted as URLs, such as <code>&#x27;https://www.rubensworks.net/&#x27;</code> or <code>&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en&#x27;</code>.</li>
<li>Object array elements can be different things:
<ul>
<li>A record containing <code>type</code> and <code>value</code>, such as <code>{ type: &#x27;sparql&#x27;, value: &#x27;https://dbpedia.org/sparql&#x27; }</code>.</li>
<li>An <a href="/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/">RDF/JS</a> source object, such as <a href="https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js#storing"><code>new N3Store()</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>String-based sources will lead to Comunica trying to determine their source type automatically.
Record-based sources allows you to enforce a specific source type.</p>
<p>Record-based sources can optionally contain a source-specific context within the <code>&quot;context&quot;</code> field,
in which all entries of that context will apply only to that source.</p>
<div class="note">
Learn more about <a href="/docs/query/advanced/source_types/">all available source type</a>.
</div>
<div class="note">
Some SPARQL endpoints may be recognised as a file instead of a SPARQL endpoint due to them not supporting <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/">SPARQL Service Description</a>,
which may produce incorrect results. For these cases, the <code>sparql</code> type MUST be set.
</div>
<p>For example, all of the following source elements are valid:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`...`, {
  sources: [
    &#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;,
    { type: &#x27;hypermedia&#x27;, value: &#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016/en&#x27; },
    { type: &#x27;file&#x27;, value: &#x27;https://www.rubensworks.net/&#x27; },
    new N3Store(),
    { type: &#x27;sparql&#x27;, value: &#x27;https://dbpedia.org/sparql&#x27; },
    { type: &#x27;sparql&#x27;, value: &#x27;https://query.wikidata.org/sparql&#x27;, context: { httpTimeout: 60_000 } },
  ],
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="4--defining-an-update-destination">4. Defining an update destination</h2>
<p>If you are executing an update query over more than one source,
then you need to specify the <code>destination</code> of the resulting update.
More details on this can be found in the guide on <a href="/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/">updating in a JavaScript app</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5--lenient-execution">5. Lenient execution</h2>
<p>By default, Comunica will throw an error when it encounters an invalid <strong>RDF document</strong> or <strong>HTTP URL</strong>.
It is possible to <strong>ignore these errors</strong> and make Comunica ignore such invalid documents and URLs
by setting <code>lenient</code> to <code>true</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  lenient: true,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="6--binding-variables">6. Binding variables</h2>
<p>Using the <code>initialBindings</code> context entry, it is possible to <strong>bind</strong> certain variables in the given query to terms before the query execution starts.
This may be valuable in case your SPARQL query is used as a template with some variables that need to be filled in.</p>
<p>This can be done by passing an <a href="http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindings-interface">RDF/JS <code>Bindings</code></a> object as value to the <code>initialBindings</code> context entry:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">import { BindingsFactory } from &#x27;@comunica/utils-bindings-factory&#x27;;
import { DataFactory } from &#x27;rdf-data-factory&#x27;;

const DF = new DataFactory();
const BF = new BindingsFactory();

const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE {
  {?s ?p ?template1 } UNION { ?s ?p ?template2 }
}`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  initialBindings: BF.fromRecord({
    template1: factory.literal(&#x27;Value1&#x27;),
    template2: factory.literal(&#x27;Value2&#x27;),
  }),
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>Bindings</code> can be created using any <a href="http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindingsfactory-interface">RDF/JS <code>BindingsFactory</code></a>,
such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/utils-bindings-factory"><code>@comunica/utils-bindings-factory</code></a>.
Learn more about the creation of these bindings objects in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/bindings/">bindings guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="7--setting-the-query-format">7. Setting the query format</h2>
<p>By default, queries in Comunica are interpreted as SPARQL queries.
As such, the <code>queryFormat</code> entry defaults to <code>{ language: &#x27;sparql&#x27;, version: &#x27;1.1&#x27; }</code>.</p>
<p>Since Comunica is not tied to any specific <strong>query format</strong>, it is possible to change this to something else, such as <code>{ language: &#x27;graphql&#x27;, version: &#x27;1.0&#x27; }</code>.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/">GraphQL-LD guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="8--setting-a-base-iri">8. Setting a Base IRI</h2>
<p>Terms in SPARQL queries can be relative to a certain <strong>Base IRI</strong>.
Typically, you would use the <code>BASE</code> keyword in a SPARQL query to set this Base IRI.
If you want to set this Base IRI without modifying the query,
then you can define it in the context using <code>baseIRI</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE {
  ?s &lt;/relative&gt; ?o
}`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  baseIRI: &#x27;http://example.org/&#x27;,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="9--enabling-a-logger">9. Enabling a logger</h2>
<p>A logger can be set using <code>log</code>.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/logging/">logging guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="10--setting-a-custom-date">10. Setting a custom date</h2>
<p>Using <code>datetime</code>, a custom <strong>date</strong> can be set in Comunica.
The range of this field must always be a JavaScript <code>Date</code> object:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  date: new Date(),
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This date is primarily used for the SPARQL <code>NOW()</code> operator.
It is also used when performing time travel querying using the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/memento/">Memento protocol</a>.</p>
<h2 id="11--enabling-an-http-proxy">11. Enabling an HTTP proxy</h2>
<p>All HTTP requests can be run through a proxy using <code>httpProxyHandler</code>.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/proxying/">HTTP proxy guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="12--include-credentials-in-http-requests">12. Include credentials in HTTP requests</h2>
<p><em>Only applicable when running in the browser</em></p>
<p>If this option is enabled, then all cross-site requests will be made using credentials of the current page.
This includes cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates.</p>
<p>Enabling this option has no effect on same-site requests.</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  httpIncludeCredentials: true,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="13--send-requests-via-http-basic-authentication">13. Send requests via HTTP basic authentication</h2>
<p>Via HTTP Basic Authentication one can include <strong>username and password</strong> credentials in HTTP requests.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/">HTTP basic authentication guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="14--sparql-extension-functions">14. SPARQL extension functions</h2>
<p>SPARQL allows non-standard, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#extensionFunctions">custom extension functions</a> to be used within queries.
In order to provide an implementation to these extension functions,
Comunica allows developers to plug them in via the context.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/">SPARQL extension functions guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="15--using-a-custom-fetch-function">15. Using a custom fetch function</h2>
<p>By default, Comunica will use the built-in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"><code>fetch</code> function</a> to make HTTP requests.
It is however possible to pass a custom function that will be used instead for making HTTP requests,
as long as it follows the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API</a>.</p>
<p>This can be done as follows:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  fetch: myfetchFunction,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p><em>If you want to perform authenticated HTTP requests for Solid, you may want to consider using <a href="https://comunica.dev/docs/query/advanced/solid/">Comunica Solid</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="16--http-timeout">16. HTTP Timeout</h2>
<p>By default Communica does not apply any timeout on the HTTP requests done to external services. It is possible to add a timeout using the <code>httpTimeout</code> option which value is the timeout delay in milliseconds. For example to add an HTTP timeout of 60s:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  httpTimeout: 60_000,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>It is also possible to make this timeout not only apply until the response starts streaming in but until the response body is fully consumed using the <code>httpBodyTimeout</code> boolean option. It is useful to limit cases like very long response streams:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  httpTimeout: 60_000,
  httpBodyTimeout: true
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="17--union-default-graph">17. Union Default Graph</h2>
<p>By default, Comunica will only query over the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#unnamedGraph">default graph</a>.
If you want to query over triples in other named graphs, you need to specify this via the <code>GRAPH</code>, <code>FROM</code>, or <code>FROM NAMED</code> clauses.
However, by setting the <code>unionDefaultGraph</code> context option to <code>true</code>, triples patterns will also apply to triples in the non-default graph.</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  unionDefaultGraph: true,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="18--http-retries">18. HTTP Retries</h2>
<p>Using the <code>httpRetryOnServerError</code>, <code>httpRetryCount</code>, and <code>httpRetryDelay</code> options,
you can make your engine retry requests for a number of times if the server produces an error for it.</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  httpRetryOnServerError: true,
  httpRetryCount: 3,
  httpRetryDelay: 100,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="19--broken-link-recovery">19. Broken link recovery</h2>
<p>The <code>recoverBrokenLinks</code> option can make your engine fall back to the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">WayBack Machine</a> if a document has become unavailable.</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/20140114.rdf&#x27;],
  recoverBrokenLinks: true,
});
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="20--deduplicate-quads-in-construct-queries">20. Deduplicate quads in construct queries</h2>
<p>The <code>distinctConstruct</code> option can remove duplicate quads from CONSTRUCT query outputs.
This corresponds to placing a <code>DISTINCT</code> onto a <code>CONSTRUCT</code> operator (which is not allowed by the SPARQL specification).</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`CONSTRUCT WHERE { ?s1 ?p1 ?o1. ?s2 ?p2 ?o2 }`, {
  sources: [&#x27;https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
  distinctConstruct: true,
});

Defining an update destination\n\nIf you are executing an update query over more than one source,\nthen you need to specify the `destination` of the resulting update.\nMore details on this can be found in the guide on [updating in a JavaScript app](/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/).\n\n## 5. Lenient execution\n\nBy default, Comunica will throw an error when it encounters an invalid **RDF document** or **HTTP URL**.\nIt is possible to **ignore these errors** and make Comunica ignore such invalid documents and URLs\nby setting `lenient` to `true`:\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  lenient: true,\n});\n```\n\n## 6. Binding variables\n\nUsing the `initialBindings` context entry, it is possible to **bind** certain variables in the given query to terms before the query execution starts.\nThis may be valuable in case your SPARQL query is used as a template with some variables that need to be filled in.\n\nThis can be done by passing an [RDF/JS `Bindings`](http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindings-interface) object as value to the `initialBindings` context entry:\n```javascript\nimport { BindingsFactory } from '@comunica/utils-bindings-factory';\nimport { DataFactory } from 'rdf-data-factory';\n\nconst DF = new DataFactory();\nconst BF = new BindingsFactory();\n\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE {\n  {?s ?p ?template1 } UNION { ?s ?p ?template2 }\n}`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  initialBindings: BF.fromRecord({\n    template1: factory.literal('Value1'),\n    template2: factory.literal('Value2'),\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n`Bindings` can be created using any [RDF/JS `BindingsFactory`](http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindingsfactory-interface),\nsuch as [`@comunica/utils-bindings-factory`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/utils-bindings-factory).\nLearn more about the creation of these bindings objects in the [bindings guide](/docs/query/advanced/bindings/).\n\n## 7. Setting the query format\n\nBy default, queries in Comunica are interpreted as SPARQL queries.\nAs such, the `queryFormat` entry defaults to `{ language: 'sparql', version: '1.1' }`.\n\nSince Comunica is not tied to any specific **query format**, it is possible to change this to something else, such as `{ language: 'graphql', version: '1.0' }`.\nMore information on this can be found in the [GraphQL-LD guide](/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/).\n\n## 8. Setting a Base IRI\n\nTerms in SPARQL queries can be relative to a certain **Base IRI**.\nTypically, you would use the `BASE` keyword in a SPARQL query to set this Base IRI.\nIf you want to set this Base IRI without modifying the query,\nthen you can define it in the context using `baseIRI`:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE {\n  ?s \u003c/relative\u003e ?o\n}`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  baseIRI: 'http://example.org/',\n});\n```\n\n## 9. Enabling a logger\n\nA logger can be set using `log`.\nMore information on this can be found in the [logging guide](/docs/query/advanced/logging/).\n\n## 10. Setting a custom date\n\nUsing `datetime`, a custom **date** can be set in Comunica.\nThe range of this field must always be a JavaScript `Date` object:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  date: new Date(),\n});\n```\n\nThis date is primarily used for the SPARQL `NOW()` operator.\nIt is also used when performing time travel querying using the [Memento protocol](/docs/query/advanced/memento/).\n\n## 11. Enabling an HTTP proxy\n\nAll HTTP requests can be run through a proxy using `httpProxyHandler`.\nMore information on this can be found in the [HTTP proxy guide](/docs/query/advanced/proxying/).\n\n## 12. Include credentials in HTTP requests\n\n_Only applicable when running in the browser_\n\nIf this option is enabled, then all cross-site requests will be made using credentials of the current page.\nThis includes cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates.\n\nEnabling this option has no effect on same-site requests.\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  httpIncludeCredentials: true,\n});\n```\n\n## 13. Send requests via HTTP basic authentication\n\nVia HTTP Basic Authentication one can include **username and password** credentials in HTTP requests.\nMore information on this can be found in the [HTTP basic authentication guide](/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/).\n\n## 14. SPARQL extension functions\n\nSPARQL allows non-standard, [custom extension functions](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#extensionFunctions) to be used within queries.\nIn order to provide an implementation to these extension functions,\nComunica allows developers to plug them in via the context.\nMore information on this can be found in the [SPARQL extension functions guide](/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/).\n\n## 15. Using a custom fetch function\n\nBy default, Comunica will use the built-in [`fetch` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make HTTP requests.\nIt is however possible to pass a custom function that will be used instead for making HTTP requests,\nas long as it follows the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).\n\nThis can be done as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  fetch: myfetchFunction,\n});\n```\n\n_If you want to perform authenticated HTTP requests for Solid, you may want to consider using [Comunica Solid](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/advanced/solid/)._\n\n\n## 16. HTTP Timeout\n\nBy default Communica does not apply any timeout on the HTTP requests done to external services. It is possible to add a timeout using the `httpTimeout` option which value is the timeout delay in milliseconds. For example to add an HTTP timeout of 60s:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  httpTimeout: 60_000,\n});\n```\n\nIt is also possible to make this timeout not only apply until the response starts streaming in but until the response body is fully consumed using the `httpBodyTimeout` boolean option. It is useful to limit cases like very long response streams:\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  httpTimeout: 60_000,\n  httpBodyTimeout: true\n});\n```\n\n## 17. Union Default Graph\n\nBy default, Comunica will only query over the [default graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#unnamedGraph).\nIf you want to query over triples in other named graphs, you need to specify this via the `GRAPH`, `FROM`, or `FROM NAMED` clauses.\nHowever, by setting the `unionDefaultGraph` context option to `true`, triples patterns will also apply to triples in the non-default graph. \n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  unionDefaultGraph: true,\n});\n```\n\n## 18. HTTP Retries\n\nUsing the `httpRetryOnServerError`, `httpRetryCount`, and `httpRetryDelay` options,\nyou can make your engine retry requests for a number of times if the server produces an error for it.\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  httpRetryOnServerError: true,\n  httpRetryCount: 3,\n  httpRetryDelay: 100,\n});\n```\n\n## 19. Broken link recovery\n\nThe `recoverBrokenLinks` option can make your engine fall back to the [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) if a document has become unavailable.\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {\n  sources: ['http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/20140114.rdf'],\n  recoverBrokenLinks: true,\n});\n```\n\n## 20. Deduplicate quads in construct queries\n\nThe `distinctConstruct` option can remove duplicate quads from CONSTRUCT query outputs.\nThis corresponds to placing a `DISTINCT` onto a `CONSTRUCT` operator (which is not allowed by the SPARQL specification).\n\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`CONSTRUCT WHERE { ?s1 ?p1 ?o1. ?s2 ?p2 ?o2 }`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n  distinctConstruct: true,\n});\n```\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/advanced/context","sortedPaths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/blog/2024-07-05-release_3_2/","/blog/2024-10-15-release_4_0/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/linking_local_version/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/advanced/where_provenance/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/performance/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/board/":{"title":"Board of Directors","description":"The board makes decisions regarding the Comunica Association"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
