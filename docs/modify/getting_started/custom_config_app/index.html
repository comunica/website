<a href="/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/">querying with a custom config from the command line</a>.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll do the same from within a JavaScript application,
but we will <strong>split up our config across different files</strong> for convenience.</p>
<div class="note">
This guide assumes basic knowledge on querying with Comunica.
If you haven&#x27;t looked into this yet, it is recommended to follow
<a href="/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/">the getting started guide on querying within a JavaScript app</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="1--installation">1. Installation</h2>
<div class="note">
This assumes you already have an npm package.
If you don&#x27;t have one yet, create one using <code>npm init</code>.
You will also need a JavaScript file to write in, such as <code>main.js</code>.
</div>
<p>In order to add Comunica SPARQL as a <em>dependency</em> to your <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> application,
we can execute the following command:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install @comunica/query-sparql
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="2--creating-a-new-query-engine">2. Creating a new query engine</h2>
<p>While <a href="/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/"><code>QueryEngine</code> is used to import Comunica SPARQL&#x27;s default config</a>,
we can load a custom config by creating our engine via <code>newEngineDynamic()</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const QueryEngineFactory = require(&#x27;@comunica/query-sparql&#x27;).QueryEngineFactory;

const myEngine = await new QueryEngineFactory().create({
    configPath: &#x27;config.json&#x27;, // Relative or absolute path 
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>configPath</code> refers to a config file, which we will create in the next step.</p>
<h2 id="3--start-from-an-existing-config-file">3. Start from an existing config file</h2>
<p>The easiest way to create a custom config, is to start from an existing one, and add/remove things to fit your needs.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s create a file called <code>config.json</code> in your package.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will start from
the <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/config-default.json">Comunica SPARQL default config file</a>.
Let&#x27;s <strong>copy its contents entirely into our <code>config.json</code></strong>:</p>

</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="4--executing-sparql-select-queries">4. Executing SPARQL SELECT queries</h2>
<p>Once your engine has been created based on your custom config,
you can use it to execute any SPARQL query, such as a <code>SELECT</code> query:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-javascript">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`
  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {
    ?s ?p &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium&gt;.
    ?s ?p ?o
  } LIMIT 100`, {
  sources: [&#x27;http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
});

bindingsStream.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (binding) =&gt; {
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;s&#x27;).value);
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;p&#x27;).value);
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;o&#x27;).value);
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you wrote this in a file called <code>main.js</code>, you can invoke it by executing <code>node main.js</code>.</p>
<div class="note">
If you run into config loading problems,
make sure your app has a <code>package.json</code> file,
otherwise config loading will fail.
</div>
<h2 id="5--only-allowing-select-queries">5. Only allowing <code>SELECT</code> queries</h2>
<p>Our goal in this step is to build a query engine that can <strong><em>only</em> execute <code>SELECT</code></strong> queries,
and we don&#x27;t want to be able to execute <code>CONSTRUCT</code> and <code>DESCRIBE</code> queries.
This will require us to remove some more actors.</p>
<p>While the actors for <code>CONSTRUCT</code> and <code>DESCRIBE</code> are defined in <code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code>,
we can not just simply remove that file from our imports,
because it also contains actors for other SPARQL query operators which we don&#x27;t want to remove, such as <code>SELECT</code>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/">guide on querying with a custom config from the command line</a>,
we achieved this by inlining <code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code> into our main config file.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll do this in a cleaner way by <strong>redefining</strong> the contents of <code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code>
in a <strong>separate local file</strong>, and applying our changes there.</p>
<h3 id="5-1--declare-config-options-in-package-json">5.1. Declare config options in <code>package.json</code></h3>
<p>Before we can refer to other files within our config file,
we have to add some entries to our <code>package.json</code> file
so that the config files can be found during engine initialization.</p>
<p>Concretely, we need to <strong>add the following entry to <code>package.json</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{
  ...
  &quot;lsd:module&quot;: true
  ...
}
</code></pre></pre>
<div class="note">
If you want to learn more about what this entry means,
read our guide on <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/">Components.js</a>,
a dependency injection framework that Comunica uses.
</div>
<h3 id="5-2--create-a-context">5.2. Create a context</h3>
<p>In order to allow our config file to import other files,
we need to create a JSON-LD context file.</p>
<p>Create the file <strong><code>components/context.jsonld</code></strong> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;@context&quot;: [
    &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^5.0.0/components/context.jsonld&quot;,
    {
      &quot;npmd&quot;: &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/&quot;,
      &quot;my&quot;: &quot;npmd:my-package/^1.0.0/&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Again, make sure to replace <code>my-package</code> with your package <code>name</code>.</p>
<div class="note">
To avoid collisions with other packages, it is recommended to use another prefix than <code>&quot;my&quot;</code> in your context.
</div>
<h3 id="5-3--copying-config-query-operation-actors-json">5.3. Copying <code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code></h3>
<p>Next, we will create a local copy of <code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code>.</p>
<p>For this, create a file <strong><code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code></strong>,
and paste in the contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comunica/comunica/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/query-operation/actors.json"><code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/query-operation/actors.json">GitHub</a>).</p>
<h3 id="5-4--make-config-refer-to-local-config-query-operation-actors-json">5.4. Make config refer to local <code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code></h3>
<p>Now that we have declared config options in our <code>package.json</code>,
created a context,
and created a local copy of <code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code>,
everything is ready to <strong>modify our <code>config.json</code> to refer to our local <code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code></strong>.</p>
<p>For this, remove the following line from <code>config.json</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-diff">-  &quot;ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json&quot;,
</code></pre></pre>
<p>And replace it with the following line:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-diff">+  &quot;my:config/query-operation/actors.json&quot;,
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Also add the newly created config to the contexts of the config file (again replacing <code>my-package</code> with your package <code>name</code>):</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-diff">    &quot;@context&quot;: [
+     &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld&quot;,
      &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/config-query-sparql/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld&quot;
    ],
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This change means that Comunica will load its query operators from our local <code>config/query-operation/actors.json</code> file,
instead of the default <code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json</code> file.</p>
<p>If you run your app again, things should still function like before at this point.</p>
<h3 id="5-5--remove-actors">5.5. Remove actors</h3>
<p>Next, we will remove the actors we don&#x27;t need.
Concretely, we will remove the following imports to actors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/construct.json</code>: Handles <code>CONSTRUCT</code> queries.</li>
<li><code>ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/describe.json</code>: Handles <code>DESCRIBE</code> queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this, remove the following lines:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-diff">-    &quot;ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/construct.json&quot;,
-    &quot;ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/describe.json&quot;,
</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="5-6--test-changes">5.6. Test changes</h3>
<p>After this change, you should now be unable to execute <code>CONSTRUCT</code> or <code>DESCRIBE</code> queries.
Try this out by executing the following:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">const quadStream = await myEngine.queryQuads(`
  CONSTRUCT WHERE {
    ?s ?p ?o
  } LIMIT 100`, {
  sources: [&#x27;http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
});

quadStream.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (quad) =&gt; {
    console.log(quad.subject.value);
    console.log(quad.predicate.value);
    console.log(quad.object.value);
    console.log(quad.graph.value);
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Executing a <code>SELECT</code> query will still work:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`
  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {
    ?s ?p &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium&gt;.
    ?s ?p ?o
  } LIMIT 100`, {
  sources: [&#x27;http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en&#x27;],
});

bindingsStream.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (binding) =&gt; {
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;s&#x27;).value);
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;p&#x27;).value);
    console.log(binding.get(&#x27;o&#x27;).value);
});
</code></pre></pre>
<p>You have now successfully built your own custom Comunica engine that is a bit more lightweight than the default one.
Just like the <code>CONSTRUCT</code> and <code>DESCRIBE</code> actors,
you can remove any other actors you don&#x27;t want to make it even more lightweight.</p>
<p>If you want, you can create additional config file parts in <code>config/</code>
and refer to them from our main <code>config.json</code> with the <code>my:</code> prefix.</p>
<div class="note">
If you want to <em>add</em> an actor that is not present in the default Comunica SPARQL config,

Start from an existing config file\n\nThe easiest way to create a custom config, is to start from an existing one, and add/remove things to fit your needs.\n\nLet's create a file called `config.json` in your package.\n\nIn this guide, we will start from\nthe [Comunica SPARQL default config file](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/config-default.json).\nLet's **copy its contents entirely into our `config.json`**:\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/config-query-sparql/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"import\": [\n    \"ccqs:config/context-preprocess/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/context-preprocess/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/hash-bindings/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/hash-bindings/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/http/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/http/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/http-invalidate/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/http-invalidate/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/init/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/merge-bindings-context/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/merge-bindings-context/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/optimize-query-operation/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/optimize-query-operation/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-operation/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-parse/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-parse/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-process/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-process/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-result-serialize/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-result-serialize/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-source-identify/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-source-identify/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-source-identify-hypermedia/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/query-source-identify-hypermedia/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/dereference/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/dereference/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/dereference-rdf/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/dereference-rdf/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join-entries-sort/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join-entries-sort/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join-selectivity/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-join-selectivity/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata-accumulate/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata-accumulate/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata-extract/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-metadata-extract/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-parse/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-parse/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-parse-html/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links-queue/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links-queue/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-serialize/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-serialize/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-update-hypermedia/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-update-hypermedia/mediators.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-update-quads/actors.json\",\n    \"ccqs:config/rdf-update-quads/mediators.json\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Executing SPARQL SELECT queries\n\nOnce your engine has been created based on your custom config,\nyou can use it to execute any SPARQL query, such as a `SELECT` query:\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p \u003chttp://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium\u003e.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nbindingsStream.on('data', (binding) =\u003e {\n    console.log(binding.get('s').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('p').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('o').value);\n});\n```\n\nIf you wrote this in a file called `main.js`, you can invoke it by executing `node main.js`.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"note\"\u003e\nIf you run into config loading problems,\nmake sure your app has a \u003ccode\u003epackage.json\u003c/code\u003e file,\notherwise config loading will fail.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## 5. Only allowing `SELECT` queries\n\nOur goal in this step is to build a query engine that can **_only_ execute `SELECT`** queries,\nand we don't want to be able to execute `CONSTRUCT` and `DESCRIBE` queries.\nThis will require us to remove some more actors.\n\nWhile the actors for `CONSTRUCT` and `DESCRIBE` are defined in `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json`,\nwe can not just simply remove that file from our imports,\nbecause it also contains actors for other SPARQL query operators which we don't want to remove, such as `SELECT`.\n\nIn the [guide on querying with a custom config from the command line](/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/),\nwe achieved this by inlining `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json` into our main config file.\nIn this guide, we'll do this in a cleaner way by **redefining** the contents of `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json`\nin a **separate local file**, and applying our changes there.\n\n### 5.1. Declare config options in `package.json`\n\nBefore we can refer to other files within our config file,\nwe have to add some entries to our `package.json` file\nso that the config files can be found during engine initialization.\n\nConcretely, we need to **add the following entry to `package.json`**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": true\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"note\"\u003e\nIf you want to learn more about what this entry means,\nread our guide on \u003ca href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/\"\u003eComponents.js\u003c/a\u003e,\na dependency injection framework that Comunica uses.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### 5.2. Create a context\n\nIn order to allow our config file to import other files,\nwe need to create a JSON-LD context file.\n\nCreate the file **`components/context.jsonld`** with the following contents:\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^5.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    {\n      \"npmd\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/\",\n      \"my\": \"npmd:my-package/^1.0.0/\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAgain, make sure to replace `my-package` with your package `name`.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"note\"\u003e\nTo avoid collisions with other packages, it is recommended to use another prefix than \u003ccode\u003e\"my\"\u003c/code\u003e in your context.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### 5.3. Copying `config/query-operation/actors.json`\n\nNext, we will create a local copy of `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json`.\n\nFor this, create a file **`config/query-operation/actors.json`**,\nand paste in the contents of [`ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comunica/comunica/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/query-operation/actors.json) ([GitHub](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/query-operation/actors.json)).\n\n### 5.4. Make config refer to local `config/query-operation/actors.json`\n\nNow that we have declared config options in our `package.json`,\ncreated a context,\nand created a local copy of `config/query-operation/actors.json`,\neverything is ready to **modify our `config.json` to refer to our local `config/query-operation/actors.json`**.\n\nFor this, remove the following line from `config.json`:\n```diff\n-  \"ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json\",\n```\nAnd replace it with the following line:\n```diff\n+  \"my:config/query-operation/actors.json\",\n```\n\nAlso add the newly created config to the contexts of the config file (again replacing `my-package` with your package `name`):\n```diff\n    \"@context\": [\n+     \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n      \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/config-query-sparql/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n    ],\n```\n\nThis change means that Comunica will load its query operators from our local `config/query-operation/actors.json` file,\ninstead of the default `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors.json` file.\n\nIf you run your app again, things should still function like before at this point.\n\n### 5.5. Remove actors\n\nNext, we will remove the actors we don't need.\nConcretely, we will remove the following imports to actors:\n\n* `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/construct.json`: Handles `CONSTRUCT` queries.\n* `ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/describe.json`: Handles `DESCRIBE` queries.\n\nFor this, remove the following lines:\n```diff\n-    \"ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/construct.json\",\n-    \"ccqs:config/query-operation/actors/query/describe.json\",\n```\n\n### 5.6. Test changes\n\nAfter this change, you should now be unable to execute `CONSTRUCT` or `DESCRIBE` queries.\nTry this out by executing the following:\n```bash\nconst quadStream = await myEngine.queryQuads(`\n  CONSTRUCT WHERE {\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nquadStream.on('data', (quad) =\u003e {\n    console.log(quad.subject.value);\n    console.log(quad.predicate.value);\n    console.log(quad.object.value);\n    console.log(quad.graph.value);\n});\n```\n\nExecuting a `SELECT` query will still work:\n```bash\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p \u003chttp://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium\u003e.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nbindingsStream.on('data', (binding) =\u003e {\n    console.log(binding.get('s').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('p').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('o').value);\n});\n```\n\nYou have now successfully built your own custom Comunica engine that is a bit more lightweight than the default one.\nJust like the `CONSTRUCT` and `DESCRIBE` actors,\nyou can remove any other actors you don't want to make it even more lightweight.\n\nIf you want, you can create additional config file parts in `config/`\nand refer to them from our main `config.json` with the `my:` prefix.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"note\"\u003e\nIf you want to \u003cem\u003eadd\u003c/em\u003e an actor that is not present in the default Comunica SPARQL config,\nhave a look at \n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/comunica/examples/tree/master/packages/configure-sparql-http-solid\"\u003ethis example on replacing the HTTP actor with a Solid HTTP

tooling to more easily track down performance issues.\nConcretely, we improved our query explain output,\nstarted running multiple benchmarks in our CI to avoid performance regressions,\nand applied several performance improvements that were identified following these changes.\n\n"},"/blog/2024-10-15-release_4_0/":{"title":"Release 4.0: 🚄 Faster actor testing and modularized expressions","excerpt":"\nEarlier this year, [Comunica version 3.0 was released](/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/),\nwhich introduced better querying planning across data sources and several convenience features.\nSince then, we had several minor releases introducing multiple additions and performance improvements.\nIn [release 3.2](/blog/2024-07-05-release_3_2/), we introduced better techniques for discovering performance bottleneck.\nThis allowed us identify some low-level bottlenecks in the internals of Comunica which limited performance.\nFixing these issues requires breaking changes to the internal API of Comunica,\nwhich is the main reason for this major update.\nAs a result of these changes, we see **performance improvements of 20% to 40%**.\nBreaking changes are limited to internal Comunica APIs.\nThis means that developers that make use of Comunica can have their cake _and_ eat it 🎂;\nno breaking changes _and_ gaining a performance boost.\n\n"},"/blog/2025-04-29-release_4_2/":{"title":"Release 4.2: 🍇 Towards real-world federation improvements","excerpt":"\nIn this release, we mainly focused on taking steps towards solving practical problems\nthat are encountered when performing federated SPARQL queries in real-world use cases.\nIn addition, a variety of low-level performance improvements were applied.\n\n"},"/blog/2025-09-17-release_4_4/":{"title":"Release 4.4: 🌸 Quality-of-life features and optimizations","excerpt":"\nThis release primarily includes several QoL features, performance improvements, and robustness changes.\nSome of the most notable changes are mentioned below.\n\nBehind the scenes, we are also working hard towards support for the upcoming [SPARQL 1.2 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql12-query/),\nfor which we plan a new release shortly after the specification transitions to recommendation stage.\n\n"},"/contribute/":{"title":"Contribute","description":"Contribute to the development of Comunica."},"/docs/":{"title":"Documentation","description":"Overview of all Comunica
