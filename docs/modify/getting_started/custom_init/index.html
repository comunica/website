so that we can <strong>expose it as a proper reusable query engine</strong>.
This package will be able to do everything packages such as Comunica SPARQL (<code>@comunica/query-sparql</code>) can do.
This means that this package will have a CLI tool, and that it will expose a JavaScript API for use in other packages.</p>

<p>Initialize a new <strong>empty npm package</strong> as follows:</p>

<p>The simplest way to include all required Comunica dependencies is to extend from <strong>Comunica SPARQL</strong>.
As such, add it as a dependency as follows:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install @comunica/query-sparql

<div class="note">
If you want to create a more lightweight package by selecting only those dependencies that are absolutely required,
you can make use of the <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/packager">Comunica Packager</a>.
</div>
<p>We recommend to also <strong>install TypeScript</strong> as a dev dependency:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install -D typescript
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Add a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file with the following contents:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{

If your custom config also depends on other packages

<h2 id="2--add-a-config-file">2. Add a config file</h2>
<h3 id="2-1--create-config-file">2.1. Create config file</h3>
<p>We assume here that <strong>you already have created a custom config file</strong>.
<a href="/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/">Click here to learn how to create one</a> should you not have done this already.</p>
<p>Create a <code>config/</code> folder, and add your config file (<code>config-default.json</code>) in here.</p>
<p>If your config file includes other config sets, you can include them in this folder as well.
In this case, you also have to make sure to include the context file in <code>components/context.jsonld</code>.</p>
<p>The only requirement here is that there is at least a file <strong><code>config/config-default.json</code></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-2--declare-config-options-in-package-json">2.2. Declare config options in <code>package.json</code></h3>
<div class="note">
If your config file is decomposed into several files,
you may already have done this step.
</div>
<p>Before we can refer to other files within our config file,
we have to add the <code>&quot;lsd:module&quot;</code> entry to our <code>package.json</code> file
so that the config files can be found during engine initialization.</p>
<p>Concretely, we need to <strong>add the following entry to <code>package.json</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{
  ...
  &quot;lsd:module&quot;: true
  ...
}
</code></pre></pre>
<div class="note">
If you want to learn more about what this config entry means,
read our guide on <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/">Components.js</a>,

</div>
<h2 id="3--compiling-the-config-into-javascript">3. Compiling the config into JavaScript</h2>
<p>In order to make the query engine start as fast as possible,
we will pre-compile our config file into a JavaScript file.</p>
<p>We will configure this in such as way that we can still modify our config file if needed,
and recompile the JavaScript file easily.</p>
<p>For this, add the following <strong>scripts to our <code>package.json</code></strong> file:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{
  ...
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;build:engine&quot;: &quot;comunica-compile-config config/config-default.json &gt; engine-default.js&quot;,
    &quot;build:lib&quot;: &quot;tsc&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;npm run build:lib &amp;&amp; npm run build:engine&quot;,
    &quot;prepare&quot;: &quot;npm run build&quot;
  },
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>You can use the build script later as follows:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm run build
</code></pre></pre>
<p>At this moment however, that will still fail due to missing files, but you can already do this now:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm run build:engine
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Afterwards, you should have an <code>engine-default.js</code> file in your folder.</p>
<h2 id="4--creating-command-line-tools">4. Creating command line tools</h2>
<p>In this step, we will create three command line tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bin/query.js</code>: The main CLI tool.</li>
<li><code>bin/http.js</code>: Script for starting a SPARQL endpoint.</li>
<li><code>bin/query-dynamic.js</code>: A <a href="/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/">CLI tool in which you can load a custom config</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these CLI tools are optional, and you only have to create those you want.
For this, <strong>create the following files</strong>:</p>
<p><code>bin/query.js</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">#!/usr/bin/env node
import { runArgsInProcessStatic } from &#x27;@comunica/runner-cli&#x27;;
runArgsInProcessStatic(require(&#x27;../engine-default.js&#x27;)());
</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>bin/http.js</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">#!/usr/bin/env node
import { HttpServiceSparqlEndpoint } from &#x27;@comunica/actor-init-query&#x27;;
const defaultConfigPath = `${__dirname}/../config/config-default.json`;
HttpServiceSparqlEndpoint.runArgsInProcess(process.argv.slice(2), process.stdout, process.stderr, `${__dirname}/../`, process.env, defaultConfigPath, code =&gt; process.exit(code))
  .catch(error =&gt; process.stderr.write(`${error.message}/n`));
</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>bin/query-dynamic.js</code>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">#!/usr/bin/env node
import { runArgsInProcess } from &#x27;@comunica/runner-cli&#x27;;
runArgsInProcess(`${__dirname}/../`, `${__dirname}/../config/config-default.json`);
</code></pre></pre>
<p>As a final step, we have to make sure that we expose our CLI tools from the package.
As such, add the following <strong>bin entries to <code>package.json</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{
  ...
  &quot;bin&quot;: {
    &quot;my-comunica&quot;: &quot;./bin/query.js&quot;,
    &quot;my-comunica-http&quot;: &quot;./bin/http.js&quot;,
    &quot;my-comunica-dynamic&quot;: &quot;./bin/query-dynamic.js&quot;
  },
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><em>You can replace <code>my-comunica</code> with any name you want.</em></p>
<p>If needed, <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/">custom arguments may be added to CLI tools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5--exposing-a-javascript-api">5. Exposing a JavaScript API</h2>
<p>In order to use your query engine as a dependency in other packages,
we have to expose its JavaScript API.
We will also immediately make it browser-friendly.</p>
<p>For this, create the following files:</p>
<p><strong><code>lib/QueryEngine.ts</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { QueryEngineBase } from &#x27;@comunica/actor-init-query&#x27;;
import type { ActorInitQueryBase } from &#x27;@comunica/actor-init-query&#x27;;
const engineDefault = require(&#x27;../engine-default.js&#x27;);

/**

export class QueryEngine extends QueryEngineBase {
  public constructor(engine: ActorInitQueryBase = engineDefault()) {
    super(engine);
  }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><strong><code>lib/QueryEngineFactory.ts</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">import { QueryEngineFactoryBase } from &#x27;@comunica/actor-init-query&#x27;;
import { QueryEngine } from &#x27;./QueryEngine&#x27;;

/**

 */
export class QueryEngineFactory extends QueryEngineFactoryBase&lt;QueryEngine&gt; {
  public constructor() {
    super(
      `${__dirname}/../`,
      `${__dirname}/../config/config-default.json`,
      actorInitQuery =&gt; new QueryEngine(actorInitQuery),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><strong><code>lib/index.ts</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">export * from &#x27;./QueryEngine&#x27;;
export * from &#x27;./QueryEngineFactory&#x27;;

<p><strong><code>lib/index-browser.ts</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">export * from &#x27;./QueryEngine&#x27;;
</code></pre></pre>
<p>As a final step,
make sure to expose the following entries in your <strong><code>package.json</code></strong> file:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text">{
  ...
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;lib/index.js&quot;,
  &quot;types&quot;: &quot;lib/index&quot;,

<h2 id="6--indicating-what-files-should-be-published">6. Indicating what files should be published</h2>
<p>Not all files should be published to npm when releasing the package,

<p><code>.npmignore</code></p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-text"></code></pre></pre>

Indicating what files should be published\n\nNot all files should be published to npm when releasing the package,\nand not all files should be added to git repositories.\n\nFor this **create the following files**:\n\n`.npmignore`\n```text\n```\n_`.npmignore` MUST exist and MUST be empty._\n\n`.gitignore`\n```text\nengine-default.js\nnode_modules\nlib/**/*.js\nlib/**/*.js.map\nlib/**/*.d.ts\ntest/**/*.js\ntest/**/*.js.map\ntest/**/*.d.ts\nbin/**/*.js\nbin/**/*.js.map\nbin/**/*.d.ts\n```\n\nAs a final step, **add following entries to `package.json`**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"files\": [\n    \"components\",\n    \"config\",\n    \"bin/**/*.d.ts\",\n    \"bin/**/*.js\",\n    \"bin/**/*.js.map\",\n    \"lib/**/*.d.ts\",\n    \"lib/**/*.js\",\n    \"lib/**/*.js.map\",\n    \"engine-default.js\"\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## 7. Publish to npm\n\nNow, you are ready to [publish your package to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages),\nand allow other to use it via the CLI or via the JavaScript API.\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init","sortedPaths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/blog/2024-07-05-release_3_2/","/blog/2024-10-15-release_4_0/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/linking_local_version/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/advanced/where_provenance/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/board/":{"title":"Board of Directors","description":"The board makes decisions regarding the Comunica Association"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
