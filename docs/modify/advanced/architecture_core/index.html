which gives us the desired <strong>modularity</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>
<p>This core architecture has been implemented in <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/core"><code>@comunica/core</code></a>.</p>
<p>On top of this architecture, the more high-level <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/">SPARQL architecture</a> has been defined.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="core-components--actor--mediator--and-bus">Core components: Actor, Mediator, and Bus</h2>
<p>Comunica&#x27;s architecture has been designed with flexibility and loose coupling of components as main goals.
For this, Comunica consists of <strong>three types of components</strong>: <strong>actors</strong>, <strong>mediators</strong>, and <strong>buses</strong>.</p>
<p>All logic in Comunica is separated into different <strong>actors</strong> (<a href="https://comunica.github.io/comunica/classes/core.Actor.html"><code>Actor</code></a>),
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a>.
Each actor independently performs a specific task.
For example, one actor can take implement the SPARQL <code>UNION</code> operator,
another actor can parse JSON-LD documents,
and another actor can parse JSON-LD documents <em>in a different way</em>.</p>
<p>All actors are subscribed onto task-specific <strong>buses</strong> (<a href="https://comunica.github.io/comunica/classes/core.Bus.html"><code>Bus</code></a>),
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe pattern</a>.
For example, a SPARQL query operator bus could contain actors for <code>UNION</code>, <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FILTER</code>, and more.
An RDF parsing bus could contain actors for JSON-LD, RDFa, Turtle, and more.</p>
<p>Since multiple actors can exist for solving a specific task
(for example if we have two actors for parsing JSON-LD documents),
<strong>mediators</strong> (<a href="https://comunica.github.io/comunica/classes/core.Mediator.html"><code>Mediator</code></a>) are used for determining the &quot;best&quot; actor on a bus for executing a certain action,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern">mediator pattern</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure loose coupling of components, actors never communicate with each other directly.
Instead, they always communicate via a mediators and buses, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="docs-intro-img">
  <img src="/img/actor-mediator-bus.svg" alt="Actor Mediator Bus Architecture" style="width:100%"/>
</div>
<div class="note">
With <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/observers/">Observers</a>, you can passively observe actions executed by actors on a given bus.
</div>
<div class="note">
Optionally, actors can <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/logging/">log certain events</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="run-and-test-phases-for-selecting-an-actor">Run and test phases for selecting an actor</h2>
<p>Different mediators can select actors in different ways.
For this, the <strong>mediator</strong> will go through <strong>two phases</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Test phase</strong>: The action is sent onto the bus to all subscribed actors. The actors return the estimated conditions under which the action could be executed, without actually executing the action.</li>
<li><strong>Run phase</strong>: The action is sent to a single actor for execution, where this actor is chosen by the mediator based on the returned test conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, the following figure shows an example of a mediator that will always pick the fastest actor on the bus as possible.</p>
<div class="docs-intro-img">
  <img src="/img/run-test-phases.svg" alt="Run and test phase" style="width:100%"/>
</div>
<p>Therefore, an actor must at least expose the following methods:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-typescript">export interface Actor {
  test(action: IAction): Promise&lt;IActorTest&gt;;
  run(action: IAction): Promise&lt;IActorOutput&gt;;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The interfaces <code>IAction</code>, <code>IActorTest</code>, and <code>IActorOutput</code> depend on the bus this actor is subscribed to.</p>
<p>Learn more about the <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/buses/">actors, buses</a> and <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/">mediators</a> that exist in Comunica.</p>
<h2 id="wiring-of-components">Wiring of components</h2>
<p>All Comunica actors, buses, and mediators are implemented as <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages">separate npm packages</a>.
In order to <em>wire</em> these different components with each other in a single application,
we make use of the <strong>dependency injection</strong> framework <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/">Components.js</a>.
Components.js allows us to wire components with each other using one or more <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/#creating-configurations-in-json-ld">configuration files</a>.
Plugging in different components therefore do not require any code changes, but simply a config change.</p>
<p>Considering these different types of components,
we make use of the following naming conventions for packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buses: <code>@comunica/bus-[name-of-bus-type]</code></li>
<li>Mediators: <code>@comunica/mediator-[name-of-mediator]</code></li>
<li>Actors: <code>@comunica/actor-[name-of-bus-type]-[name-of-actor]</code></li>
<li>Mediator types: <code>@comunica/mediatortype-[name-of-mediator-type]</code></li>
