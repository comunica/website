a high number of <strong>modules that need to be wired together</strong> before they can be used.</p>
<p>Comunica makes use of the <strong>dependency injection framework <a href="https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Components.js</a></strong>
to take care of this wiring of modules.
In essence, Components.js allows you to create <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> configuration files
in which you <em>declaratively</em> define which components you want to instantiate using what parameters.
Components.js can then <em>read</em> these configuration files, and instantiate them as runtime JavaScript objects.</p>
<p>While there is <a href="https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">detailed documentation available for Components.js</a>,
we summarize the most important parts for Comunica on this page.</p>
<div class="note">
Before you get into the details of Components.js,
we recommend you first follow <a href="/docs/modify/getting_started/">guides on getting started with modifying Comunica</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>Before you continue reading this guide,
it is important to understand the three following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module:</strong> A collection of <strong>components</strong>. <em>For example, an npm package.</em></li>
<li><strong>Component:</strong> Something that can be instantiated. <em>For example, a JavaScript/TypeScript class.</em></li>
<li><strong>Instance:</strong> An instantiated <strong>component</strong>. <em>For example, a JavaScript/TypeScript class instance.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the npm package <code>@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash</code> is a <strong>module</strong>
that exposes a single <strong>component</strong> <code>ActorQueryOperationReducedHash</code>,
which implements the SPARQL <code>REDUCED</code> operator.
During dependency injection, any number of <strong>instances</strong> of the component <code>ActorQueryOperationReducedHash</code>
can be created, possibly with different parameters values.</p>
<h2 id="describing-modules-in-json-ld">Describing modules in JSON-LD</h2>
<p>The <code>components/</code> directory of each package contains JSON-LD representations of the module and its components,
which <strong>describe how components can be instantiated</strong>.
As of Comunica version 2.x, the contents of this directory are automatically generated
using <a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/">Components-Generator.js</a>,
which is invoked when running <code>yarn run build</code>.</p>
<p>While <strong>these files should never be created or modified manually</strong>,
some examples below are shown to explain their most important parts.</p>

</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>import</code> key allows components to be defined across different files,
where its values internally translate into a local file path.
For example, <code>&quot;caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld&quot;</code>
corresponds to the local file <code>components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld</code>.</p>
<p>The prefix <code>caqorh:</code> identifies the scope of this package.
Internally, this gives all files a unique URL
that makes all modules and components <em>semantic</em> and fully dereferenceable.
For example, <code>&quot;caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld&quot;</code>
expands to the URL <a href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/%40comunica%2Factor-query-operation-reduced-hash/%5E3.0.0/components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld">https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/%40comunica%2Factor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<a href="https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/">Linked Software Dependencies</a> is a service
that exposes all npm packages as JSON-LD,
which forms a key element in Components.js.

and <a href="https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/components/general/">components</a>.</p>
<h2 id="context-files">Context files</h2>
<p>The so-called context is another file in the <code>components/</code> directory that will be automatically generated using
<a href="https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/">Components-Generator.js</a>
when invoking <code>yarn run build</code>.</p>
<p>This context is needed because
our components and config files always make use of URLs as identifiers for things (<code>@id</code> in JSON-LD).
Since URLs sometimes can become long, we make use of <em>JSON-LD context files</em>
to <strong>define shortcuts and prefixes for some URLs</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the context for our reduced actor (defined in <code>components/context.jsonld</code>) could look as follows (simplified):</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;@context&quot;: [
    &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^5.0.0/components/context.jsonld&quot;,
    {
      &quot;npmd&quot;: &quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/&quot;,
      &quot;caqorh&quot;: &quot;npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^2.0.0/&quot;,
      &quot;ActorQueryOperationReducedHash&quot;: {
        &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash&quot;,
        &quot;@prefix&quot;: true,
        &quot;@context&quot;: {
          &quot;cacheSize&quot;: {
            &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_cacheSize&quot;
          },
          &quot;mediatorQueryOperation&quot;: {
            &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_mediatorQueryOperation&quot;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The relevant entries in this file that become reusable are <code>caqorh</code>, <code>ActorQueryOperationReducedHash</code>, <code>cacheSize</code>, and <code>mediatorQueryOperation</code>.
Do note that <code>cacheSize</code> and <code>mediatorQueryOperation</code> will <em>only</em> be usable within instances of <code>ActorQueryOperationReducedHash</code>, i.e., when instantiating <code>ActorQueryOperationReducedHash</code> via <code>&quot;@type&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to use these prefixes in any other file,
the full URL of this context has to be used in <code>&quot;@context&quot;</code>.
This URL will always be in the form of <code>&quot;https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/&lt;my-package&gt;/^&lt;major-version-of-my-package&gt;.0.0/components/context.jsonld&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-configurations-in-json-ld">Creating configurations in JSON-LD</h2>
<p>Configuration files are used to <strong>instantiate components</strong>.
While modules and components are defined in the <code>components/</code> folder,
we typically create our config files in <code>config/</code>.
We also define these as JSON-LD files, with pointers to our components files.</p>
<p>The instantiation of a Comunica engine could look like this:</p>

package.\nInternally, this gives all files a unique URL\nthat makes all modules and components _semantic_ and fully dereferenceable.\nFor example, `\"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld\"`\nexpands to the URL https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/%40comunica%2Factor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"note\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/\"\u003eLinked Software Dependencies\u003c/a\u003e is a service\nthat exposes all npm packages as JSON-LD,\nwhich forms a key element in Components.js.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nLearn more in the Components.js documentation on [modules](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/modules/)\nand [components](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/components/general/).\n\n## Context files\n\nThe so-called context is another file in the `components/` directory that will be automatically generated using\n[Components-Generator.js](https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/)\nwhen invoking `yarn run build`.\n\nThis context is needed because\nour components and config files always make use of URLs as identifiers for things (`@id` in JSON-LD).\nSince URLs sometimes can become long, we make use of _JSON-LD context files_\nto **define shortcuts and prefixes for some URLs**.\n\nFor example, the context for our reduced actor (defined in `components/context.jsonld`) could look as follows (simplified):\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^5.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    {\n      \"npmd\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/\",\n      \"caqorh\": \"npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^2.0.0/\",\n      \"ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\": {\n        \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n        \"@prefix\": true,\n        \"@context\": {\n          \"cacheSize\": {\n            \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_cacheSize\"\n          },\n          \"mediatorQueryOperation\": {\n            \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_mediatorQueryOperation\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant entries in this file that become reusable are `caqorh`, `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`, `cacheSize`, and `mediatorQueryOperation`.\nDo note that `cacheSize` and `mediatorQueryOperation` will _only_ be usable within instances of `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`, i.e., when instantiating `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash` via `\"@type\"`.\n\nIf you want to use these prefixes in any other file,\nthe full URL of this context has to be used in `\"@context\"`.\nThis URL will always be in the form of `\"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/\u003cmy-package\u003e/^\u003cmajor-version-of-my-package\u003e.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"`.\n\n## Creating configurations in JSON-LD\n\nConfiguration files are used to **instantiate components**.\nWhile modules and components are defined in the `components/` folder,\nwe typically create our config files in `config/`.\nWe also define these as JSON-LD files, with pointers to our components files.\n\nThe instantiation of a Comunica engine could look like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/runner/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-init-query/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-construct/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"  \n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:my\",\n  \"@type\": \"Runner\",\n  \"actors\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:init/actors#query\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorInitQuery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/actors#reduced\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n      \"mediatorQueryOperation\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/mediators#main\" },\n      \"mediatorHashBindings\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:hash-bindings/mediators#main\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/actors#construct\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationConstruct\",\n      \"mediatorQueryOperation\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/mediators#main\" }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLearn more in the full Components.js documentation on [configs](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/configurations/semantic/).\n\n## Package.json contents\n\nIf you want to expose components or use modular configs in your npm package,\n**you must enable a flag in your `package.json` file so that Components.js can find your npm package**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": true\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nLearn more in the full Components.js documentation on [exposing components](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/basics/exposing_components/).\n\n### More control over Components.js configuration (optional)\n\nWhile this is optional,\nyou can configure yourself where Components.js can find required files (components, contexts, configs) in your npm package**.\n\nFor this, you can add the following entries to your `package.json` file:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package\",\n  \"lsd:components\": \"components/components.jsonld\",\n  \"lsd:contexts\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\": \"components/context.jsonld\"\n  },\n  \"lsd:importPaths\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/\": \"components/\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/config/\": \"config/\"\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n_On each line, make sure to replace `my-package` with your package `name`._\n\nThese entries have the following meaning:\n\n* `lsd:module`: The URL that corresponds to your npm package. This will mostly be `https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/` appended by your package name.\n* `lsd:components`: Local path to your root components file. This will mostly be `components/components.jsonld`.\n* `lsd:contexts`: The mapping of context URLs to local context files. This will typically contain only one entry for `components/context.jsonld`, but can be empty. This is used by Components.js when looking up contexts to first look in the local file system, to avoid expensive HTTP(S) lookups if the file already exists locally.\n* `lsd:importPaths`: The mapping of component and config files to local files. This will typically contain entries for `components/` and `config/`. This is used by Components.js when looking up components or config imports to first look in the local file system, to avoid expensive HTTP(S) lookups if the file already exists locally.\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs","sortedPaths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/blog/2024-07-05-release_3_2/","/blog/2024-10-15-release_4_0/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/linking_local_version/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/advanced/where_provenance/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/performance/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/board/":{"title":"Board of Directors","description":"The board makes decisions regarding the Comunica Association"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
