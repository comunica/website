backwards-compatible with every update.\nHowever, as with every software project, there is sometimes a need to make breaking changes\nso that old mechanisms can be replaced with better, newer ones.\nWith this update, we have aggregated several breaking changes into one large update,\nall of which should improve the lives of users one way or another.\nBelow, the primary changes are listed.\n\n<!-- excerpt-end -->\n\n## New query API\n\nFor most people, the biggest change will be in the way you use Comunica for query execution,\nas the package names of the default query engines have been renamed,\nand the JavaScript API has been improved.\n\n### New package names\n\nUp until now, you may have been using `@comunica/actor-init-sparql` (or a variant) as your main entry point for query execution.\n**This main entrypoint has been moved to `@comunica/query-sparql`** (or `@comunica/query-sparql-file` and `@comunica/query-sparql-rdfjs`).\nThis means that your imports and the dependencies in your `package.json` file will require updates.\n\nThe first reason for this renaming is the fact that the new names are shorter and easier to remember.\nThe second reason is mainly for people that want to configure their own Comunica engines,\nwhere the Query Init actor has been decoupled from the query engine entrypoints to simplify the creation of new engines.\n\n### Improved JavaScript query API\n\nAnother major change is related to the way you create and use a Comunica query engine in JavaScript.\nMainly, the following changes have been made:\n\n- `newEngine` has been replaced with the class `QueryEngine` that can be instantiated with the `new` keyword.\n- New result-dependent query methods have been added for simpler result consumption:\n  - `queryBindings` for SELECT queries\n  - `queryQuads` for CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE queries.\n  - `queryBoolean` for ASK queries\n  - `queryVoid` for update queries\n- The general `query` method still exists, but has been changed.\n- The methods on a Bindings object have been changed and improved, and obtaining values for variables does not require the `?` prefix anymore.\n- If you are using TypeScript, make sure to bump `@rdfjs/types` to at least `1.1.0`.\n\nLearn more about the new API in the [guide on querying in a JavaScript app](/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/).\n\nBelow, you can see an example of a simple SPARQL SELECT query execution in the old and new versions of Comunica.\n\n**Before (Comunica 1.x):**\n```typescript\nconst newEngine = require('@comunica/actor-init-sparql').newEngine;\nconst myEngine = newEngine();\n\nconst result = await myEngine.query(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nresult.bindingsStream.on('data', (binding) => {\n  console.log(binding.get('?s').value);\n});\nbindingsStream.on('end', () => {});\nbindingsStream.on('error', (error) => console.error(error));\n```\n\n**After (Comunica 2.x):**\n```typescript\nconst QueryEngine = require('@comunica/query-sparql').QueryEngine;\nconst myEngine = new QueryEngine();\n\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nbindingsStream.on('data', (binding) => {\n  console.log(binding.toString()); // New: quick way to print bindings\n  console.log(binding.get('s').value);\n});\nbindingsStream.on('end', () => {});\nbindingsStream.on('error', (error) => console.error(error));\n```\n\nThis new query API is largely aligned with the recently created [RDF/JS query specification](https://rdf.js.org/query-spec/),\nwhich makes Comunica better interactable and interchangeable within the RDF JavaScript ecosystem.\n\n## Easier engine modifications\n\nBased on the feedback we received from developers that configure their own Comunica engines or implement their own Comunica packages,\nwe have refactored the internals of Comunica in several places to simplify these processes.\n\n### Automatic generation of components files\n\nComunica makes use of the dependency injection framework [Components.js](/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/)\nto load its configuration files.\nA requirement for this framework is that each package should expose a semantic description of its classes, i.e., the _components files_.\nThese components files are located within the `components/` directory of each package.\nWhile these files had to be manually created before,\nthese files can now be automatically generated from the TypeScript sources\nusing [Components-Generator.js](https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/).\nThis significantly reduces the effort when creating new Comunica packages.\nLearn more about this in the [getting started with modification guides](/docs/modify/getting_started/).\n\n### Config restructuring\n\nUp until now, all configuration files were split up in smaller fragments, but using an arbitrary fragmentation strategy.\nWith this update, all configuration files now use a consistent fragmentation strategy,\nwhere a separate sub-directory exists for each Comunica bus, in which one or more files can exist per actor.\nFurthermore, all configuration files have been moved to a new dedicated (zero-dependency) package\n[`@comunica/config-query-sparql`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/engines/config-query-sparql/),\nwhich simplifies reuse and extension of these config fragments.\nLearn more about this new config structure in the [README of `@comunica/config-query-sparql`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/engines/config-query-sparql/config/README.md).\n\n## Internal changes for better performance\n\nOne primary aspect of [our roadmap](/roadmap/) is to [improve overall performance](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/846).\nIn this update, we refactored the way in which [join operations](/docs/modify/advanced/joins/) are handled,\nbecause these were not flexible enough before, which hindered optimizations.\n\nConcretely, Comunica used to handle most join operations within the Basic Graph Pattern actor,\nwhich made it impossible to use these join operators for joins with other types of operations,\nsuch as property paths, which thereby made these operations very slow.\nWith this refactoring, the join operator implementations have been fully decoupled from the Basic Graph Pattern actor,\nwhich for example makes joins between triple patterns and property paths much more efficient.\n\nWhile performance will be much better in many cases,\nthere are still a lot of [opportunities open for further optimization](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/846).\nWe welcome [contributions](/contribute/) for making these optimizations a reality.\n\nLearn more about [joins in Comunica](/docs/modify/advanced/joins/).\n\n## Explaining query plans\n\nMost large-scale query engines offer some way of inspecting _how_ exactly a query engine will execute a given query,\nwhich is something Comunica has been lacking so far.\n\nWith this update, you can inspect in detail the exact query plan and actors that were used for executing a given query.\nThis functionality exists both on the command-line (via `--explain`), as in the JavaScript API.\nFor example, the command below shows an example of a physical plan that is printed for a given query:\n\n\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n  -q 'SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o. ?s a ?o } LIMIT 100' --explain physical\n\n{\n  \"logical\": \"slice\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"logical\":

     },\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"estimate\",\n                  \"value\": 100022186\n                }\n              ],\n              \"joinCoefficients\": {\n

},\n...\n```\n\nLearn more about [explaining query plans in Comunica](/docs/query/advanced/explain/).\n\n## Webinar\n\nDue to all of these changes and simplifications,\nwe are planning a public webinar in which the basic usage of Comunica will be explained.\nThis will be useful for new developers that want to get started with Comunica,\nand developers that have used Comunica before, but want to learn about the new ways of using it.\nThis is also a perfect time for new contributors to become part of the community,\nor possibly even the [Comunica Association](/association/).\nMore news on this webinar will follow later.\n\n## Full changelog\n\nWhile this blog post explained the primary changes in Comunica 2.x,\nthere are actually many more smaller changes internally that will make your lives easier.\nIf you want to learn more about these changes, check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v201---2022-03-02).\n","excerpt":"\nSince its
