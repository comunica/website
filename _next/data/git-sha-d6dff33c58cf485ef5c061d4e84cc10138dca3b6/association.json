{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"body":"\nThe Comunica Association is a **non-profit organization** for establishing a roadmap,\nand ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica framework and its dependencies.\n\n## Members and sponsors\n\nIf your organization is using Comunica, and you want to support its continued maintenance and future development,\nyou may consider [**donating or becoming a sponsor via Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/comunica-association).\nThis will allow the association to fund core maintainers of Comunica to manage issues and pull requests, and to fund overall development.\nFurthermore, your organization will have the option to prioritize certain issues.\nAnother option is to become a **board member**, which will give your organization access to [board meetings](/association/board/) of the Comunica Association\nwhich will enable your organization to collaboratively determine the long-term vision and roadmap of Comunica and the Association.\n\n<div class=\"docs-intro-img\">\n  <img src=\"/img/association_members.svg\" alt=\"Comunica Association Members and Sponsors\" style=\"width:100%\" \\>\n</div>\n\nFeel free to [contact us](mailto:ruben.taelman@ugent.be) if you want to discuss alternative forms of support,\nor regarding any related questions.\n\n<div className=\"grid\">\n\n  <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/comunica-association\" className=\"card\">\n    <h3>New Member/Sponsor &rarr;</h3>\n    <p>Join via Open Collective</p>\n  </a>\n\n  <a href=\"/association/board/\" className=\"card\">\n    <h3>Board of Directors &rarr;</h3>\n    <p>Learn more about the board</p>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n## Bounties\n\nAnother goal of the Comunica Association, is to\n**connect organizations** that are in **need of improvements or features**, to **developers** seeking funding.\n\n<div class=\"docs-intro-img\">\n  <img src=\"/img/association_overview.svg\" alt=\"Comunica Association Overview\" style=\"width:75%\" \\>\n</div>\n\nUsing our Bounty Program,\norganizations can place [**bounties on issues**](/association/bounties/),\nand developers may work on them for an agreed upon price.\nThese bounties are primarily useful for issues that have a clearly defined scope, and are not too large.\nLarger issues with an unclear scope may be better suited for becoming part of the general roadmap,\nwhich is decided by Board Members,\nof which [your organization can also become a part of](#members-and-sponsors).\n\n<div className=\"grid\">\n  <a href=\"/association/bounties/\" className=\"card\">\n    <h3>List of bounties &rarr;</h3>\n    <p>Express your interest to work on a feature or bug</p>\n  </a>\n\n  <a href=\"/association/bounty_process/\" className=\"card\">\n    <h3>Bounty procedures &rarr;</h3>\n    <p>Learn more about how bounties are placed and managed</p>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n## Learn more\n\nIf you want to be notified about future developments around this association, submit your email address below!\n\n<iframe

marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\">Loading...</iframe>\n\nThe Comunica Association is an activity within [Open Knowledge Belgium](https://openknowledge.be/),\nand our budget is visible on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/comunica-association).\n\n<p className=\"bounty-page-footer\">\n  * Sponsors that want to have an issue prioritized should <a href=\"mailto:ruben.taelman@ugent.be\">contact us</a>.\n  The board will decide the final order of issue handling based on historical sponsorship contribution and developer availability.\n</p>\n","excerpt":"","path":"/association","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_output_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn
