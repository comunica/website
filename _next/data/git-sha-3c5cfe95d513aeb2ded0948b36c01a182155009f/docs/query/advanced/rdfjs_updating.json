interface](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#store-interface).\nThis allows you to pass objects as destination to Comunica as long as they implement this interface.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nLearn more about RDF/JS in this <a href=\"/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/\">RDF/JS guide</a>.\n</div>\n\nSeveral implementations of this `Store` interface exist.\nIn the example below, we make use of the [`Store` from `N3.js`](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js#storing)\nthat offers one possible implementation when you want to [query over it with Comunica within a JavaScript application](/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/):\n```javascript\nconst store = new N3.Store();\n\nconst query = `\nPREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>\nINSERT DATA\n{ \n  <http://example/book1> dc:title \"A new book\" ;\n                         dc:creator \"A.N.Other\" .\n}\n`;\n\n// Execute the update\nawait myEngine.queryVoid(query, {\n  sources: [store],\n});\n\n// Prints '2' => the store is updated\nconsole.log(store.size);\n```\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn
