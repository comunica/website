{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Querying in a JavaScript app","description":"Execute SPARQL queries from within your application using the JavaScript API."},"body":"\nThe default Comunica query engine that exposes most standard features is Comunica SPARQL,\nwhich uses the package name `@comunica/query-sparql`.\nIn this guide, we will install it as a dependency in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript application,\nand show how it can be used to execute queries.\n\n<div class=\"video\">\nWatch part of this guide in action <em>live</em> within this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ydpdziVNw1k?t=1175\">Webinar recording</a>.\n</div>\n\n## 1. Installation\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nThis assumes you already have an npm package.\nIf you don't have one yet, create one using <code>npm init</code>.\nYou will also need a JavaScript file to write in, such as <code>main.js</code>.\n</div>\n\nIn order to add Comunica SPARQL as a _dependency_ to your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application,\nwe can execute the following command:\n```bash\n$ npm install @comunica/query-sparql\n```\n\n## 2. Creating a new query engine\n\nThe easiest way to create an engine is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst QueryEngine = require('@comunica/query-sparql').QueryEngine;\n\nconst myEngine = new QueryEngine();\n```\n\nYou can reuse an engine as often as possible.\nThis is especially valuable if you repeatedly query over the same sources,\nas [caching](/docs/query/advanced/caching/) can be performed. \n\n## 3. Executing SPARQL SELECT queries\n\nOnce you engine has been created, you can use it to execute any SPARQL query, such as a `SELECT` query:\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n```\n\nThe first argument of `queryBindings()` is a SPARQL query string,\nand the second argument is a [query context](/docs/query/advanced/context/) containing options,\nwhich must at least contain an array of sources to query over. \n\nThe resulting `bindingsStream` is a stream of **bindings**,\nwhere each binding contains values for the selected variables (`?s ?p ?o`).\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nWhile the <code>sources</code> is the only required option in the query context,\n<a href=\"/docs/query/advanced/context/\">additional options can be passed</a>\nto tweak how the engine executed the query.\n</div>\n\n### 3.1 Consuming binding results as a stream\n\nThe most efficient way to make use of the result,\nis by adding a **data-listener** to the `bindingsStream`:\n```javascript\nbindingsStream.on('data', (binding) => {\n    console.log(binding.toString()); // Quick way to print bindings for testing\n\n    console.log(binding.has('s')); // Will be true\n    \n    // Obtaining values\n    console.log(binding.get('s').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('s').termType);\n    console.log(binding.get('p').value);\n    console.log(binding.get('o').value);\n});\n```\n\nThe data-listener will be invoked _for each resulting binding_,\nas soon as the query engine has detected it.\nThis means that the data-listener can be invoked many times during query execution,\neven if not all results are available yet.\n\nEach `binding` is an [RDF/JS `Bindings`](http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindings-interface) object\nthat contains mappings from variables to RDF terms.\nVariable names can either be obtained by string label (without the `?` prefix) or via [RDF/JS](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/) variable objects,\nand bound RDF terms are represented as [RDF/JS](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/) terms.\nLearn more about the usage of these bindings objects in the [bindings guide](/docs/query/advanced/bindings/).\n\nTo find out when the query execution has **ended**,\nand all results are passed to the data-listener,\nan **end-listener** can be attached as well.\n```javascript\nbindingsStream.on('end', () => {\n    // The data-listener will not be called anymore once we get here.\n});\n```\n\nIt is also considered good practise to add an **error-listener**,\nso you can detect any problems that have occurred during query execution:\n```javascript\nbindingsStream.on('error', (error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n});\n```\n\n### 3.2 Consuming binding results as an async iterable\n\nUsing a for-await loop, you can consume bindings as an [async iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols).\nWhile this is more compact than the stream-based approach, it may lead to a slightly lower level of performance:\n\n```javascript\nfor await (const bindings of bindingsStream) {\n    console.log(bindings.get('s').value);\n    console.log(bindings.get('s').termType);\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3 Consuming binding results as an array\n\nIf performance is not an issue in your application,\nor you just want the results in a simple array,\nthen you can call the asynchronous `toArray()` method on the `bindingsStream`:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindings = await bindingsStream.toArray();\n\nconsole.log(bindings[0].get('s').value);\nconsole.log(bindings[0].get('s').termType);\n```\n\nThis method will return asychronously (using `await`) as soon as _all_ results have been found.\nIf you have many results, it is recommended to consume results iteratively via a data listener instead.\n\nEach binding in the array is again an [RDF/JS `Bindings`](http://rdf.js.org/query-spec/#bindings-interface) object.\n\nIf you want to limit the number of results in the array, you can optionally pass a limit:\n```javascript\nconst bindings = await bindingsStream.toArray({ limit: 100 });\n```\n\n## 4. Executing queries over multiple sources\n\nQuerying over more than one source is trivial,\nas any number of sources can easily be passed via an array:\n```javascript\nconst bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: [\n    'http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en',\n    'https://www.rubensworks.net',\n    'https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/',\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n## 5. Executing SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries\n\nNext to `SELECT` queries, you can also execute a `CONSTRUCT` query to generate RDF quads/triples:\n```javascript\nconst quadStream = await myEngine.queryQuads(`\n  CONSTRUCT WHERE {\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n```\n\n### 5.1 Consuming quad results as a stream\n\nThe most efficient way to make use of the resulting RDF quads,\nis by adding a **data-listener** to the `quadStream`:\n```javascript\nquadStream.on('data', (quad) => {\n    console.log(quad.subject.value);\n    console.log(quad.predicate.value);\n    console.log(quad.object.value);\n    console.log(quad.graph.value);\n});\n```\n\nThe data-listener will be invoked _for each constructed RDF triple/quad_,\nas soon as the query engine has created it.\nThis means that the data-listener can be invoked many times during query execution,\neven if not all results are available yet.\n\nEach `quad` is an [RDF/JS](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/) quad,\nwhich contain `subject`, `predicate`, `object` and `graph` terms.\n\nJust like `bindingsStream`, **end-listener** and **error-listener** can also be attached:\n\n```javascript\nquadStream.on('end', () => {\n    // The data-listener will not be called anymore once we get here.\n});\nquadStream.on('error', (error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n});\n```\n\n### 5.2 Consuming quad results as an async iterable\n\nJust like with binding results,\nquads can also be consumed using for-await.:\n\n```javascript\nfor await (const quad of quadStream) {\n    console.log(quad.subject.value);\n    console.log(quad.predicate.value);\n    console.log(quad.object.value);\n    console.log(quad.graph.value);\n}\n\n```\n\n### 5.3 Consuming quad results as an array\n\nJust like with binding results,\nif performance is not an issue in your application,\nor you just want the results in a simple array,\nthen you can call the asynchronous `toArray()` method on the `bindingsStream`:\n\n```javascript\nconst quads = await quadStream.toArray();\n\nconsole.log(quads[0].subject.value);\nconsole.log(quads[0].predicate.value);\nconsole.log(quads[0].object.value);\nconsole.log(quads[0].graph.value);\n```\n\nThis method will return asychronously (using `await`) as soon as _all_ results have been found.\nIf you have many results, it is recommended to consume results iteratively via a data listener instead.\n\nEach `quad` is again an [RDF/JS](/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/) quad,\nwhich contain `subject`, `predicate`, `object` and `graph` terms.\n\n## 6. Executing SPARQL ASK queries\n\nOne of the simplest forms SPARQL is the ASK query,\nwhich can be executed in Comunica as follows:\n```javascript\nconst hasMatches = await myEngine.queryBoolean(`\n  ASK {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>\n  }`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n})\n```\n\nThe value of `hasMatches` indicates if the query has at least one result. \n\n## 7. Executing a generic query\n\nIf you don't know beforehand if your query is a `SELECT`, `CONSTRUCT`, or `ASK` (e.g. if your app accepts queries via user input),\nthen you can make use of the generic `query` method that supports all query types:\n```javascript\nconst result = await myEngine.query(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nif (result.resultType === 'bindings') {\n    const bindingsStream = await result.execute();\n\n    bindingsStream.on('data', (binding) => {\n        console.log(binding.toString());\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThe resulting object represents a _future_ to the query results.\nIf has a field `resultType` that indicates the query and result type, which can be `'bindings'`, `'quads'`, `'boolean'`, or `'void'`.\nThe asynchronous `execute` method effectively executes the query, and returns a result depending on the `resultType`, corresponding to the `queryBindings`, `queryQuads`, ... methods.\nFor example, if the result type is `'bindings'`, then the return type of `execute` will be a bindings stream.\n\nOptionally, you can also obtain metadata about the results via this `query` method for the `'bindings'` and `'quads'` result types:\n```javascript\nconst result = await myEngine.query(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\n\nif (result.resultType === 'bindings') {\n    const metadata = await result.metadata();\n    console.log(metadata.cardinality);\n    console.log(metadata.canContainUndefs);\n}\n```\n\n## 8. Serializing to a specific result format\n\nIf you want your application to output query results in a certain text-based format,\njust like [executing Comunica on the command line](/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/),\nthen you can make use of the `resultToString()` method.\n\nFor example, serializing to SPARQL JSON can be done as follows:\n```javascript\nconst result = await myEngine.query(`\n  SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE {\n    ?s ?p <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium>.\n    ?s ?p ?o\n  } LIMIT 100`, {\n  sources: ['http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en'],\n});\nconst { data } = await myEngine.resultToString(result,\n  'application/sparql-results+json');\ndata.pipe(process.stdout); // Print to standard output\n```\n\nThe `resultToString()` method accepts a query result and a result format media type.\nThe media type is optional, and will default to `application/json` for bindings, `application/trig` for quads, and `simple` for booleans.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\n<a href=\"/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/\">All available result formats</a> can be retrieved programmatically\nby invoking the asynchronous <code>getResultMediaTypes()</code> method.\n</div>\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/getting_started/query_app","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/board/":{"title":"Board of Directors","description":"The board makes decisions regarding the Comunica Association"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
