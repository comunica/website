{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Components.js","description":"Components.js is the dependency injection framework that Comunica uses to wire components via config files."},"body":"\nA direct consequence of the high modularity of Comunica is that it leads to\na high number of **modules that need to be wired together** before they can be used.\n\nComunica makes use of the **dependency injection framework [Components.js](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**\nto take care of this wiring of modules.\nIn essence, Components.js allows you to create [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) configuration files\nin which you _declaratively_ define which components you want to instantiate using what parameters.\nComponents.js can then _read_ these configuration files, and instantiate them as runtime JavaScript objects.\n\nWhile there is [detailed documentation available for Components.js](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),\nwe summarize the most important parts for Comunica on this page.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nBefore you get into the details of Components.js,\nwe recommend you first follow <a href=\"/docs/modify/getting_started/\">guides on getting started with modifying Comunica</a>.\n</div>\n\n## Terminology\n\nBefore you continue reading this guide,\nit is important to understand the three following concepts:\n\n* **Module:** A collection of **components**. _For example, an npm package._\n* **Component:** Something that can be instantiated. _For example, a JavaScript/TypeScript class._\n* **Instance:** An instantiated **component**. _For example, a JavaScript/TypeScript class instance._\n\nFor example, the npm package `@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash` is a **module**\nthat exposes a single **component** `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`,\nwhich implements the SPARQL `REDUCED` operator.\nDuring dependency injection, any number of **instances** of the component `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`\ncan be created, possibly with different parameters values.\n\n## Describing modules in JSON-LD\n\nThe `components/` directory of each package contains JSON-LD representations of the module and its components,\nwhich **describe how components can be instantiated**.\nAs of Comunica version 2.x, the contents of this directory are automatically generated\nusing [Components-Generator.js](https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/),\nwhich is invoked when running `yarn run build`.\n\nWhile **these files should never be created or modified manually**,\nsome examples below are shown to explain their most important parts.\n\n`components/components.jsonld`: (_root components file_)\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash\",\n  \"@type\": \"Module\",\n  \"requireName\": \"@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash\",\n  \"import\": [\n    \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld` (simplified):\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/core/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/bus-query-operation/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n      \"@type\": \"Class\",\n      \"requireElement\": \"ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n      \"extends\": \"cbqo:components/ActorQueryOperationTypedMediated.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationTypedMediated\",\n      \"comment\": \"A comunica Reduced Hash Query Operation Actor.\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_cacheSize\",\n          \"range\": \"xsd:integer\",\n          \"default\": \"100\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_mediatorQueryOperation\",\n          \"range\": \"cc:components/Mediator.jsonld#Mediator\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"constructorArguments\": [\n        {\n          \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args__constructorArgument\",\n          \"fields\": [\n            {\n              \"keyRaw\": \"cacheSize\",\n              \"value\": {\n                \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_cacheSize\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"keyRaw\": \"mediatorQueryOperation\",\n              \"value\": {\n                \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_mediatorQueryOperation\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe `import` key allows components to be defined across different files,\nwhere its values internally translate into a local file path.\nFor example, `\"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld\"`\ncorresponds to the local file `components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld`.\n\nThe prefix `caqorh:` identifies the scope of this package.\nInternally, this gives all files a unique URL\nthat makes all modules and components _semantic_ and fully dereferenceable.\nFor example, `\"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld\"`\nexpands to the URL https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/%40comunica%2Factor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\n<a href=\"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/\">Linked Software Dependencies</a> is a service\nthat exposes all npm packages as JSON-LD,\nwhich forms a key element in Components.js.\n</div>\n\nLearn more in the Components.js documentation on [modules](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/modules/)\nand [components](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/components/general/).\n\n## Context files\n\nThe so-called context is another file in the `components/` directory that will be automatically generated using\n[Components-Generator.js](https://github.com/LinkedSoftwareDependencies/Components-Generator.js/)\nwhen invoking `yarn run build`.\n\nThis context is needed because\nour components and config files always make use of URLs as identifiers for things (`@id` in JSON-LD).\nSince URLs sometimes can become long, we make use of _JSON-LD context files_\nto **define shortcuts and prefixes for some URLs**.\n\nFor example, the context for our reduced actor (defined in `components/context.jsonld`) could look as follows (simplified):\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/componentsjs/^5.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    {\n      \"npmd\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/\",\n      \"caqorh\": \"npmd:@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^2.0.0/\",\n      \"ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\": {\n        \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n        \"@prefix\": true,\n        \"@context\": {\n          \"cacheSize\": {\n            \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_cacheSize\"\n          },\n          \"mediatorQueryOperation\": {\n            \"@id\": \"caqorh:components/ActorQueryOperationReducedHash.jsonld#ActorQueryOperationReducedHash_args_mediatorQueryOperation\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe relevant entries in this file that become reusable are `caqorh`, `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`, `cacheSize`, and `mediatorQueryOperation`.\nDo note that `cacheSize` and `mediatorQueryOperation` will _only_ be usable within instances of `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash`, i.e., when instantiating `ActorQueryOperationReducedHash` via `\"@type\"`.\n\nIf you want to use these prefixes in any other file,\nthe full URL of this context has to be used in `\"@context\"`.\nThis URL will always be in the form of `\"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/<my-package>/^<major-version-of-my-package>.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"`.\n\n## Creating configurations in JSON-LD\n\nConfiguration files are used to **instantiate components**.\nWhile modules and components are defined in the `components/` folder,\nwe typically create our config files in `config/`.\nWe also define these as JSON-LD files, with pointers to our components files.\n\nThe instantiation of a Comunica engine could look like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/runner/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-init-query/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-hash/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-construct/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"  \n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:my\",\n  \"@type\": \"Runner\",\n  \"actors\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:init/actors#query\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorInitQuery\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/actors#reduced\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationReducedHash\",\n      \"mediatorQueryOperation\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/mediators#main\" },\n      \"mediatorHashBindings\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:hash-bindings/mediators#main\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/actors#construct\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationConstruct\",\n      \"mediatorQueryOperation\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/mediators#main\" }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLearn more in the full Components.js documentation on [configs](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/configurations/semantic/).\n\n## Package.json contents\n\nIf you want to expose components or use modular configs in your npm package,\n**you must enable a flag in your `package.json` file so that Components.js can find your npm package**:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": true\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nLearn more in the full Components.js documentation on [exposing components](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/basics/exposing_components/).\n\n### More control over Components.js configuration (optional)\n\nWhile this is optional,\nyou can configure yourself where Components.js can find required files (components, contexts, configs) in your npm package**.\n\nFor this, you can add the following entries to your `package.json` file:\n```text\n{\n  ...\n  \"lsd:module\": \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package\",\n  \"lsd:components\": \"components/components.jsonld\",\n  \"lsd:contexts\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/context.jsonld\": \"components/context.jsonld\"\n  },\n  \"lsd:importPaths\": {\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/components/\": \"components/\",\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/my-package/^1.0.0/config/\": \"config/\"\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n_On each line, make sure to replace `my-package` with your package `name`._\n\nThese entries have the following meaning:\n\n* `lsd:module`: The URL that corresponds to your npm package. This will mostly be `https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/` appended by your package name.\n* `lsd:components`: Local path to your root components file. This will mostly be `components/components.jsonld`.\n* `lsd:contexts`: The mapping of context URLs to local context files. This will typically contain only one entry for `components/context.jsonld`, but can be empty. This is used by Components.js when looking up contexts to first look in the local file system, to avoid expensive HTTP(S) lookups if the file already exists locally.\n* `lsd:importPaths`: The mapping of component and config files to local files. This will typically contain entries for `components/` and `config/`. This is used by Components.js when looking up components or config imports to first look in the local file system, to avoid expensive HTTP(S) lookups if the file already exists locally.\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/board/":{"title":"Board of Directors","description":"The board makes decisions regarding the Comunica Association"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
