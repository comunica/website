{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hypermedia","description":"Discovery of data source capabilities during query execution."},"body":"\nComunica enables **[hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)-driven query execution**.\nThis allows users to provide data sources by URL,\nand Comunica will automatically detect the querying capabilities for this source\nto determine an efficient query execution plan. \n\nThis strategy makes it so that when providing a link to a SPARQL endpoint (e.g. https://dbpedia.org/sparql),\ncommunication will be done using SPARQL queries.\nWhile when providing a link to a plain RDF file (e.g. http://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/),\nthe whole file will be downloaded and queried in-memory.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nThis page only describes the handling of hypermedia for read queries.\nThe handling of hypermedia for update queries happens in a very similar manner,\nwith the main difference that the <a href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#query-source-identify-hypermedia\">RDF Resolve Hypermedia bus</a>\nis replaced by the <a href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-update-hypermedia\">RDF Update Hypermedia bus</a>.\n</div>\n\n## Hypermedia actor\n\nThe actor in Comunica that drives hypermedia handling is\n[`@comunica/actor-query-source-identify-hypermedia`](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-rdf-resolve-quad-pattern-hypermedia).\nThis actor is registered to the [Query Source Identify bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#query-source-identify).\nThis actor will be invoked once for each query during context preprocessing,\nand the identified source will be assigned to suboperations within the query.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nThe <a href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/\">SPARQL architecture</a>\nshows how this hypermedia actor relates to all other actors and buses.\n</div>\n\n## Steps for handling hypermedia\n\nFor each URL-based data source,\nthe hypermedia actor will always go through the following steps:\n\n1. Dereference RDF ([Dereference RDF bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#dereference-rdf))\n2. Split data and metadata streams ([RDF Metadata bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-metadata))\n3. Extract metadata as object ([RDF Metadata Extract bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-metadata-extract))\n4. Determine links to other sources ([RDF Resolve Hypermedia Links bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links))\n5. Create a queue for managing links ([RDF Resolve Hypermedia Links Queue bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links-queue))\n6. Handle source based on metadata ([Query Source Identify Hypermedia bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia))\n\nHereafter, we go over these three steps using three example sources:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/\n\n## 1. Dereference RDF\n\nAn HTTP(S) request is done to retrieve the RDF data at the given location\nvia [content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation).\nDifferent ways of doing this may exist in the [Dereference RDF bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#dereference-rdf).\nConcretely, the input is an URL, and the output is a stream of parsed RDF triples/quads.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql\n```turtle\nns1:sparql\trdf:type\tsd:Service ;\n\t        sd:endpoint\tns1:sparql ;\n\t        sd:feature\tsd:UnionDefaultGraph ,\n\t\t    sd:DereferencesURIs .\n@prefix ns3:\t<http://www.w3.org/ns/formats/> .\nns1:sparql\tsd:resultFormat\tns3:SPARQL_Results_JSON ,\n\t\t    ns3:SPARQL_Results_XML ,\n\t\t    ns3:Turtle ,\n\t\t    ns3:N-Triples ,\n\t\t    ns3:N3 ,\n\t\t    ns3:RDF_XML ,\n\t\t    ns3:SPARQL_Results_CSV ,\n\t\t    ns3:RDFa ;\n\t        sd:supportedLanguage\tsd:SPARQL10Query ;\n\t        sd:url\tns1:sparql .\n```\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n```turtle\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/#dataset> hydra:member <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset>.\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset> a void:Dataset, hydra:Collection;\n    void:subset <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en>;\n    hydra:search _:triplePattern.\n_:triplePattern hydra:template \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en{?subject,predicate,object}\";\n    hydra:variableRepresentation hydra:ExplicitRepresentation;\n    hydra:mapping _:subject, _:predicate, _:object.\n_:subject hydra:variable \"subject\";\n    hydra:property rdf:subject.\n_:predicate hydra:variable \"predicate\";\n    hydra:property rdf:predicate.\n_:object hydra:variable \"object\";\n    hydra:property rdf:object.\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en> void:subset <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en>;\n    a hydra:PartialCollectionView;\n    dcterms:title \"Linked Data Fragment of DBpedia 2016-04\"@en;\n    dcterms:description \"Triple Pattern Fragment of the 'DBpedia 2016-04' dataset containing triples matching the pattern { ?s ?p ?o }.\"@en;\n    dcterms:source <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset>;\n    hydra:totalItems \"1040358853\"^^xsd:integer;\n    void:triples \"1040358853\"^^xsd:integer;\n    hydra:itemsPerPage \"100\"^^xsd:integer;\n    hydra:first <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=1>;\n    hydra:next <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=2>.\n<http://0-access.newspaperarchive.com.lib.utep.edu/us/mississippi/biloxi/biloxi-daily-herald/1899/05-06/page-6?tag=tierce+wine&rtserp=tags/tierce-wine?page=2> dbpprop:date \"1899-05-06\"^^xsd:date;\n    dbpprop:isCitedBy <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tierce_(unit)>;\n    dbpprop:newspaper \"Biloxi Daily Herald\";\n    dbpprop:page \"6\";\n    dbpprop:title \"A New System of Weights and Measures\";\n    dbpprop:url <http://0-access.newspaperarchive.com.lib.utep.edu/us/mississippi/biloxi/biloxi-daily-herald/1899/05-06/page-6?tag=tierce+wine&rtserp=tags/tierce-wine?page=2>.\n...\n```\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/\n```turtle\n<https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/>\n    a foaf:Document, foaf:PersonalProfileDocument;\n    rdfs:label \"Ruben Verborghâ€™s FOAF profile\"@en;\n    foaf:maker :me;\n    foaf:primaryTopic :me.\n:me a foaf:Person;\n    foaf:name  \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    rdfs:label \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    vcard:fn   \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    con:preferredURI \"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me\";\n    foaf:givenName \"Ruben\"@en, \"Ruben\"@nl;\n    foaf:familyName \"Verborgh\"@en, \"Verborgh\"@nl;\n...\n```\n\n## 2. Split data and metadata streams\n\nSome RDF sources may include metadata inside the document,\nsuch as [Triple Pattern Fragments](https://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/triple-pattern-fragments/).\nAs such, there needs to be a way to distinguish between data and metadata triples,\nfor which different strategies exist in the [RDF Metadata bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-metadata).\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nLearn more details about <a href=\"/docs/modify/advanced/metadata\">metadata objects</a>.\n</div>\n\nFor example:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql\n\n**Data:** _empty_\n\n**Metadata:**\n```turtle\nns1:sparql\trdf:type\tsd:Service ;\n\t        sd:endpoint\tns1:sparql ;\n\t        sd:feature\tsd:UnionDefaultGraph ,\n\t\t    sd:DereferencesURIs .\n@prefix ns3:\t<http://www.w3.org/ns/formats/> .\nns1:sparql\tsd:resultFormat\tns3:SPARQL_Results_JSON ,\n\t\t    ns3:SPARQL_Results_XML ,\n\t\t    ns3:Turtle ,\n\t\t    ns3:N-Triples ,\n\t\t    ns3:N3 ,\n\t\t    ns3:RDF_XML ,\n\t\t    ns3:SPARQL_Results_CSV ,\n\t\t    ns3:RDFa ;\n\t        sd:supportedLanguage\tsd:SPARQL10Query ;\n\t        sd:url\tns1:sparql .\n```\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n\n**Data:**\n```turtle\n<http://0-access.newspaperarchive.com.lib.utep.edu/us/mississippi/biloxi/biloxi-daily-herald/1899/05-06/page-6?tag=tierce+wine&rtserp=tags/tierce-wine?page=2> dbpprop:date \"1899-05-06\"^^xsd:date;\n    dbpprop:isCitedBy <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tierce_(unit)>;\n    dbpprop:newspaper \"Biloxi Daily Herald\";\n    dbpprop:page \"6\";\n    dbpprop:title \"A New System of Weights and Measures\";\n    dbpprop:url <http://0-access.newspaperarchive.com.lib.utep.edu/us/mississippi/biloxi/biloxi-daily-herald/1899/05-06/page-6?tag=tierce+wine&rtserp=tags/tierce-wine?page=2>.\n...\n```\n**Metadata:**\n```turtle\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/#dataset> hydra:member <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset>.\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset> a void:Dataset, hydra:Collection;\n    void:subset <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en>;\n    hydra:search _:triplePattern.\n_:triplePattern hydra:template \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en{?subject,predicate,object}\";\n    hydra:variableRepresentation hydra:ExplicitRepresentation;\n    hydra:mapping _:subject, _:predicate, _:object.\n_:subject hydra:variable \"subject\";\n    hydra:property rdf:subject.\n_:predicate hydra:variable \"predicate\";\n    hydra:property rdf:predicate.\n_:object hydra:variable \"object\";\n    hydra:property rdf:object.\n<https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en> void:subset <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en>;\n    a hydra:PartialCollectionView;\n    dcterms:title \"Linked Data Fragment of DBpedia 2016-04\"@en;\n    dcterms:description \"Triple Pattern Fragment of the 'DBpedia 2016-04' dataset containing triples matching the pattern { ?s ?p ?o }.\"@en;\n    dcterms:source <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en#dataset>;\n    hydra:totalItems \"1040358853\"^^xsd:integer;\n    void:triples \"1040358853\"^^xsd:integer;\n    hydra:itemsPerPage \"100\"^^xsd:integer;\n    hydra:first <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=1>;\n    hydra:next <https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=2>.\n```\n\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/\n\n**Data:**\n```turtle\n<https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/>\n    a foaf:Document, foaf:PersonalProfileDocument;\n    rdfs:label \"Ruben Verborghâ€™s FOAF profile\"@en;\n    foaf:maker :me;\n    foaf:primaryTopic :me.\n:me a foaf:Person;\n    foaf:name  \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    rdfs:label \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    vcard:fn   \"Ruben Verborgh\"@en, \"Ruben Verborgh\"@nl;\n    con:preferredURI \"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me\";\n    foaf:givenName \"Ruben\"@en, \"Ruben\"@nl;\n    foaf:familyName \"Verborgh\"@en, \"Verborgh\"@nl;\n...\n```\n\n**Metadata:** _empty_\n\n## 3. Extract metadata as object\n\nUsing actors on the [RDF Metadata Extract bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-metadata-extract),\nrelevant parts of the metadata stream are identified,\nand a convenient metadata object is constructed for later use.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql\n```json\n{\n  \"sparqlService\": \"https://dbpedia.org/sparql\"\n}\n```\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n```json\n{\n  \"first\": \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=1\",\n  \"next\": \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=2\",\n  \"searchForms\": {\n    \"values\": [\n      {\n        \"mappings\": {\n          \"subject\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#subject\",\n          \"predicate\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#predicate\",\n          \"object\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object\"\n        },\n        \"template\": \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en{?subject,predicate,object}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"cardinality\": { \"type\": \"estimate\", \"value\": 1040358853, \"dataset\": \"https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\" }\n}\n```\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/\n```json\n{}\n```\n\n## 4. Determine links to other sources\n\nBased on the detected metadata, links are extracted that can optionally be followed.\nThese links are determined using actors on the [RDF Resolve Hypermedia Links bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links).\n\nFor example:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql: _None_\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en: https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en?page=2\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/: _None_\n\n## 5. Create a queue for managing links\n\nUsing the [RDF Resolve Hypermedia Links Queue bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia-links-queue),\na [`ILinkQueue`](https://comunica.github.io/comunica/interfaces/_comunica_bus_rdf_resolve_hypermedia_links_queue.ilinkqueue.html) instance is created\nusing which the order is determined to process links.\n\nBy default, this will be a queue that processes links in FIFO order.\n\n## 6. Handle source based on metadata\n\nFinally, the [Query Source Identify Hypermedia bus](/docs/modify/advanced/buses/#rdf-resolve-hypermedia)\ncontains actors that can handle sources based on the extracted metadata.\n\nConcretely, the detected metadata will be given to each actor on the bus,\nand the actor that can handle it with the best _filtering capabilities_\nwill be allowed to handle it.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. https://dbpedia.org/sparql: SPARQL query to https://dbpedia.org/sparql\n2. http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en: Fill in `https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en{?subject,predicate,object}`, and follow all subsequent next-page links.\n3. https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/: No hypermedia, so fallback to querying over all triples in the returned data stream.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIf multiple links are being followed, the metadata object corresponding to the current quad pattern will be\nincrementally updated after each link that is being followed.\nThis is done using the rdf-metadata-accumulate bus, which has dedicated actors for handling how to merge specific\nmetadata fields together.\n</div>\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/board/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/blog/2021-08-30-release_1_22/","/blog/2021-11-08-comunica_association_members/","/blog/2022-03-03-release_2_0/","/blog/2022-06-29-release_2_3/","/blog/2022-07-14-association_launch/","/blog/2022-08-24-release_2_4/","/blog/2022-11-09-release_2_5/","/blog/2023-05-24-release_2_7/","/blog/2023-07-04-release_2_8/","/blog/2024-03-19-release_3_0/","/blog/2024-05-11-release_3_1/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/bindings/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/explain/","/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/actor_patterns/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/custom_cli_arguments/","/docs/modify/advanced/expression-evaluator/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/joins/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/metadata/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_operation_result_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/events/","/events/2019-06-03-eswc/","/events/2019-10-26-iswc/","/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/","/events/2022-09-13-semantics_conference/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/research/versioning/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn
