{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding a config parameter to an actor","description":"For an existing actor, add a parameter that can be customized in the config file."},"body":"\nIn this guide, we will add a parameter to an existing actor,\nand show how to set values for this parameter via the config file.\n\nWe will start from the actor we have created in the [guide on contributing a new actor](/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/).\n\n## 1. Modifying the constructor\n\nWe want to add a parameter that is set at configuration/startup time.\nFor this, we need to make sure that our actor accepts this parameter via the constructor.\n\nFor this, first create a **new interface** that is used as single argument in the constructor:\n```typescript\nexport interface IActorQueryOperationReducedMyArgs extends IActorQueryOperationTypedMediatedArgs {\n  myParam: number;\n}\n```\nHere, `IActorQueryOperationTypedMediatedArgs` is the default constructor argument\nfor query operation actors that contains common parameters that will automatically be set behind the scenes.\n\nNext, **replace our constructor** with the following:\n```typescript\npublic constructor(args: IActorQueryOperationReducedMyArgs) {\n  super(args, 'reduced');\n}\n```\n\nIn order to use the passed parameter values,\nadd the following field in your class:\n\n```typescript\nprivate readonly myParam: number;\n```\n\nIn order to temporarily check the passed parameter value,\nwe can add a `console.log` statement in the `runOperation` method.\n\nMake sure to run `yarn run build` in the repo root to make sure that your modifications\nto the TypeScript files have been compiled to JavaScript.\n\n## 2. Set values in our config file\n\nEverything has now been setup to define values for our parameter via the config file.\n\nAs such, we can **modify our declaration of our actor in `engines/config-query-sparql/config/query-operation/actors/query/reduced.json`** by adding a value for `\"myParam\"`:\n```text\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/runner/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\",\n\n    \"https://linkedsoftwaredependencies.org/bundles/npm/@comunica/actor-query-operation-reduced-my/^3.0.0/components/context.jsonld\"\n  ],\n  \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:Runner\",\n  \"@type\": \"Runner\",\n  \"actors\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/actors#reduced\",\n      \"@type\": \"ActorQueryOperationReducedMy\",\n      \"mediatorQueryOperation\": { \"@id\": \"urn:comunica:default:query-operation/mediators#main\" }\n      \"myParam\": 123\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs a test, you can now attempt a [query execution with our config](/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/#7--testing-with-comunica-sparql).\nIf you placed a `console.log` statement in your actor,\nyou should now see the value `123` on stdout.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nIn this guide, we showed how to define an integer parameter.\nYou can instead also define other parameter types,\nwhere parameters can even accept other components (such as mediators).\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nWhen running <code>yarn run build</code>, a JSON-LD representation of your TypeScript files\nwill be created in the <code>components/</code> directory of your package.\nThe <code>components/context.jsonld</code> will list all discovered parameters that you can pass within the config file.

discovering performance bottleneck.\nThis allowed us identify some low-level bottlenecks in the internals of Comunica which limited performance.\nFixing these issues requires breaking changes to the internal API of Comunica,\nwhich is the main reason for this major update.\nAs a result of these changes, we see **performance improvements of 20% to 40%**.\nBreaking changes are limited to internal Comunica APIs.\nThis means that developers that make use of Comunica can have their cake _and_ eat it 🎂;\nno breaking changes _and_ gaining a performance
