{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up a SPARQL endpoint","description":"Allow querying over HTTP via the SPARQL protocol"},"body":"\nThe [SPARQL protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) allows clients to send SPARQL queries to Web servers over HTTP,\nand query results to be sent back to the client. \nComunica SPARQL can be used to set up a **SPARQL endpoint** on top of any number of sources you want.\n\n## 1. Installation\n\nSince Comunica runs on Node.js, make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.\n\nNext, we can install Comunica SPARQL on our machine:\n```bash\n$ npm install -g @comunica/actor-init-sparql\n```\n\n## 2. SPARQL endpoint over one source\n\nAfter installing Comunica SPARQL, you will be given access to several commands including `comunica-sparql-http`,\nwhich allows you to start a SPARQL endpoint from the command line.\n\nThis command requires one or more URLs to be provided as **sources** to query over.\n\nFor example, the following command starts a SPARQL endpoint over [DBpedia](https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en):\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql-http https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n```\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nGiven a URL, Comunica will automatically detect the <a href=\"/docs/query/advanced/source_types/\">type of source</a> and handle it accordingly.\n</div>\n\nBy default, the endpoint will be exposed on port 3000.\nYour endpoint will now be live on `http://localhost:3000/sparql`.\nAny client that understands the SPARQL protocol will now be able to send queries to this URL,\nsuch as [`fetch-sparql-endpoint`](https://github.com/rubensworks/fetch-sparql-endpoint.js/), or even Comunica itself.\n\n<div class=\"note\">\nThe URL <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> will automatically redirect to <code>http://localhost:3000/sparql</code>.\n</div>\n\nYou can easily test query execution over your endpoint using a tool such as `curl`.\nThe SPARQL protocol allows sending queries via HTTP GET by passing a URL-encoded SPARQL query via the `?query=` parameter:\n```bash\n$ curl -v \"http://localhost:3000/sparql?query=CONSTRUCT%20WHERE%20%7B%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo.%7DLIMIT%20100\"\n```\n\n## 3. SPARQL endpoint over multiple sources\n\nOne key feature of Comunica is its ability to query over **multiple sources**.\nFor this, you can just supply any number of URLs as arguments.\n\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql-http https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n    https://www.rubensworks.net/ \\\n    https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/\n```\n\n## 4. Changing the port\n\nUsing the `-p` option, the port can be changed:\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql-http https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n  -p 3001\n```\n\n## 5. Increasing the number of worker threads\n\nUsing the `-w` option, the number of parallel worker threads can be set:\n```bash\n$ comunica-sparql-http https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \\\n  -w 4\n```\n\nSetting this to the number of available CPU cores tends to give the best performance.\n\n## 6. Learn more\n\nThis guide only discussed the basic functionality of `comunica-sparql-http`.\nYou can learn more options by invoking the _help_ command:\n```text\n$ comunica-sparql-http --help\n\nUsage:\n  comunica-sparql-http http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en\n  comunica-sparql-http http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en hypermedia@http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en\n  comunica-sparql-http -c context.json\n  comunica-sparql-http -c \"{ \\\"sources\\\": [{ \\\"type\\\": \\\"hypermedia\\\", \\\"value\\\" : \\\"http://fragments.dbpedia.org/2015/en\\\" }]}\"\n\nOptions:\n  -d            the destination for update queries\n  -c            context should be a JSON object or the path to such a JSON file.\n  -p            the HTTP port to run on (default: 3000)\n  -t            the query execution timeout in seconds (default: 60)\n  -w            the number of worker threads (default: 1)\n  -b            base IRI for the query (e.g., http://example.org/)\n  -l            Sets the log level (e.g., debug, info, warn, ... defaults to warn)\n  -i            a flag that enables cache invalidation before each query execution.\n  -u            enable update queries (by default only read queries are enabled)\n  --lenient     if failing requests and parsing errors should be logged instead of causing a hard crash\n  --help        print this help message\n  --version     prints version information\n```\n","excerpt":"","path":"/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint","paths":["/about/","/ask/","/association/","/association/bounty_process/","/blog/","/blog/2020-08-19-intro/","/blog/2020-08-24-release_1_16/","/blog/2020-09-25-release_1_17/","/blog/2020-11-02-release_1_18/","/blog/2021-01-18-release_1_19/","/blog/2021-03-30-release_1_20/","/blog/2021-04-27-release_1_21/","/blog/2021-06-21-comunica_association_bounties/","/contribute/","/docs/","/docs/query/","/docs/query/getting_started/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_cli/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_cli_file/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/update_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_browser_app/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_docker/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_endpoint/","/docs/query/getting_started/setup_web_client/","/docs/query/getting_started/query_dev_version/","/docs/query/usage/","/docs/query/faq/","/docs/query/advanced/","/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/","/docs/query/advanced/caching/","/docs/query/advanced/context/","/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/","/docs/query/advanced/federation/","/docs/query/advanced/graphql_ld/","/docs/query/advanced/hdt/","/docs/query/advanced/logging/","/docs/query/advanced/memento/","/docs/query/advanced/proxying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_querying/","/docs/query/advanced/rdfjs_updating/","/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/","/docs/query/advanced/solid/","/docs/query/advanced/source_types/","/docs/query/advanced/sparql_query_types/","/docs/query/advanced/specifications/","/docs/modify/","/docs/modify/getting_started/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_cli/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_config_app/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_init/","/docs/modify/getting_started/custom_web_client/","/docs/modify/getting_started/contribute_actor/","/docs/modify/getting_started/actor_parameter/","/docs/modify/extensions/","/docs/modify/faq/","/docs/modify/advanced/","/docs/modify/advanced/algebra/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/","/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_sparql/","/docs/modify/advanced/browser_builds/","/docs/modify/advanced/buses/","/docs/modify/advanced/componentsjs/","/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/","/docs/modify/advanced/logging/","/docs/modify/advanced/mediators/","/docs/modify/advanced/observers/","/docs/modify/advanced/query_output_types/","/docs/modify/advanced/rdf_parsing_serializing/","/docs/modify/advanced/sparqlee/","/docs/modify/advanced/testing/","/docs/modify/benchmarking/","/logos/","/research/","/research/amf/","/research/link_traversal/","/roadmap/"],"mattersData":{"/about/":{"title":"About","description":"Learn more about Comunica."},"/ask/":{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask questions about Comunica."},"/association/":{"title":"Comunica Association","description":"Organization for ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica"},"/association/bounty_process/":{"title":"Bounty Procedures","description":"The process for handling bounties on issues"},"/blog/":{"title":"Blog","description":"Blog posts, containing announcements or other news.","blog_index":true},"/blog/2020-08-19-intro/":{"title":"A New Website for Comunica","excerpt":"\nWe're happy to present a brand new website for Comunica! 🎉\n_Don't know that Comunica is?
