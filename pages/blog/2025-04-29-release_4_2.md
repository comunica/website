title: 'Release 4.2: üçá Towards real-world federation improvements'
---

In this release, we mainly focused on taking steps towards solving practical problems
that are encountered when performing federated SPARQL queries in real-world use cases.
In addition, a variety of low-level performance improvements were applied.

## üçá Real-world federation improvements

While many algorithms have been proposed for federating over SPARQL endpoints,
we notice there are many practical problems are encountered when running these algorithms in the real world.
For example, endpoints restrict their usage by setting timeouts, result limits, and more.

In this release, we started working towards coping with these practical problems,
to make federation more stable in realistic use cases.
This includes the introduction of a smart [HTTP rate limit actor](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/fb5962c885938f47165f40c31187441bccfe2d56),
[HTTP Retry-After header support](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/8f58dd45a3ba72b72aa030242faebd6bb46fd370),
and optimizations for [SPARQL endpoints that expose VoID descriptions](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/2e259e739b6664a932bd3f5020509730b4d600e8).
But these are just the beginning, so expect more improvements in the next upcoming releases. 

For example, the [query below over 2 Wikidata SPARQL endpoints](https://query.comunica.dev/#datasources=https%3A%2F%2Fquery-scholarly.wikidata.org%2Fsparql;https%3A%2F%2Fquery.wikidata.org%2Fsparql&query=PREFIX%20wdt%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikidata.org%2Fprop%2Fdirect%2F%3E%0APREFIX%20wd%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikidata.org%2Fentity%2F%3E%0ASELECT%20%3Fsubject%20%3FsubjectType%20%7B%0A%20%20wd%3AQ59458901%20wdt%3AP921%20%3Fsubject%20.%0A%20%20%3Fsubject%20wdt%3AP31%20%3FsubjectType%0A%7D) (that expose VoID descriptions)
can now be executed in 1.2 seconds (was ~7 seconds before).
```sparql
PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>
SELECT ?subject ?subjectType {
  wd:Q59458901 wdt:P921 ?subject .
  ?subject wdt:P31 ?subjectType
}
```

If you would run into other practical issues when executing federated queries,
be sure to [report them on our issue tracker](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues)!

## üöÑ Performance improvements

Besides the changes mentioned above,
there are a number of smaller changes that have a positive impact on performance that are worth mentioning:

* [Fix bad plans sometimes being chosen due to requestTime in files](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/cdae8eed46848e6c84eba5d5e2b7144abce444fc)
* [Fix queries with complex property paths not terminating](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/b3aa99882ff34809c2d7a24b575bc1764474a39d)
* [Skip COUNT queries to singular SPARQL source](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/2dbe28b7c2275ad45e963f353df4e6ecaeb7582d)
* [Skip unnecessary SPARQL SD requests for a single source](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/c5529ac2e01addeb1b1a5afbdbf9e29983ce1a93)
* [Allow Bind Join more for local data sources](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/db38811ab069aefd5a055e5f192d83ab887527dd)
* [Shorten code path on empty join operations](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/a7ae2e7ff44def29914347b53a73909e5858229d)
* [Remove uncommon variables handling in join entry sort](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commit/24aa68239dde047201935c189736fb7313b9bec5)

[The state of our overall performance is now available on our website](/performance/).
