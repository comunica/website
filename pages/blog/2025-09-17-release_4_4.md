title: 'Release 4.4: üå∏ Quality-of-life features and optimizations'
---

This release primarily includes several QoL features, performance improvements, and robustness changes.
Some of the most notable changes are mentioned below.

Behind the scenes, we are also working hard towards support for the upcoming [SPARQL 1.2 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql12-query/),
for which we plan a new release shortly after the specification transitions to recommendation stage.

## ü™£ Querying over RDF/JS Datasets

For compatibility with other RDF/JS projects,
Comunica already supported querying over objects implementing the [RDF/JS Source interface](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#source-interface).
As of this release, objects implementing the [RDF/JS DatasetCore interface](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/#datasetcore-interface)
are now also supported.

```javascript
const bindingsStream = await myEngine.queryBindings(`SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`, {
  sources: [ myDataset ],
});
```

For larger datasets, we still recommend using the `Source` interface over the `DatasetCore`,
as it allows intermediary results to be processed in a streaming manner, which will give you faster execution.

## ‚ûï Extension function pushdown

While we already had support for [SPARQL extension functions](/docs/query/advanced/extension_functions/),
Comunica will now be aware of which extension functions are supported in remote SPARQL endpoints.
If you execute a query with extension functions across one or more SPARQL endpoints,
and these endpoints have support for these extension functions,
Comunica will not execute these locally, but push them down to the endpoints,
which will result in better performance and reduced data transfer.
