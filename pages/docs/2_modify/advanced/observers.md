Observers are an optional element in [Comunica's core architecture](/docs/modify/advanced/architecture_core/).
They allow you to **listen to all actions on a bus**, without modifying the action's input or output.

Observers ([`ActionObserver`](https://comunica.github.io/comunica/classes/core.actionobserver-1.html)) require a `bus` parameter, which should be supplied in the config file.
Your observer implementation must override the following `onRun` method:
```typescript
interface ActionObserver {
  onRun(
    actor: Actor<IAction, IActorTest, IActorOutput>,
    action: IAction,
    output: Promise<IActorOutput>,
  ): void;
}
```
This method allows you to see the handling actor, the executed action, and a promise to the action output.
