### Using Comunica for building foundational heritage network services

At the Dutch Digital Heritage Network we’ve been building services that facilitate the discovery, use and sharing of linked data. Two examples are a realtime federated search engine (Network of Terms) and a dataset index (Dataset Register). Comunica is a great tool that allows us to efficiently query a variety of RDF sources. Plans for the future include a browser-based version and better support for fulltext SPARQL. These require some changes in Comunica, so I’ll take the opportunity to plug our wishlist.

### The more you know - easy access to enriched RDF using LDflex + Comunica

Client side query and RDF reasoning has the compacity to unlock a plethora of powerful Web applications. In this talk we demonstrate how Comunica can be used to quickly query across multiple decentralised data sources and receive results that have been enriched RDF reasoning in real-time. We will dive into real-world applications and demonstrate the power of Comunica and LDflex in creating rich user apps with minimal code.

### A querying SDK from research to practice

Comunica was conceived within IDLab as a next generation Linked Data Fragments client, that would be able to query over heterogeneous data sources. It has now grown into our flagship product that we certainly don’t want to keep only within academic mids. We believe a Comunica Association is the right step forward to also involve other universities, industry and start-ups, governments and hobbyists into a true quadruple helix collaboration. Today, we use Comunica ourselves to build a a governmental data space, and as the querying engine behind Solid applications.
