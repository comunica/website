The Comunica Association is a **non-profit organization** for establishing a roadmap,
and ensuring the maintenance and development of the Comunica framework and its dependencies.

It **connects organizations** that are in **need of improvements or features**, to **developers** seeking funding.

The Association is currently in an **incubation phase**,
during which companies can place [**bounties on issues**](/association/bounties/),
and developers may work on them for an agreed upon price.

After this incubation phase, companies and organizations will be able to become member of the Association
in order to determine the long-term vision and roadmap of Comunica and the Association.
