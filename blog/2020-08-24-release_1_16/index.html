<h2 id="sparql-1-1-query-compliance">SPARQL 1.1 Query compliance</h2>
<p>Our continuous integration tool has been configured to continuously check correctness
using unit tests, integration tests, and the SPARQL 1.1 query test suite.
So far, some tests from this test suite used to fail, primarily due to the lack of full property path support.
Thanks to the help of <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commits?author=stephaniech97">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/commits?author=FlorianFV">students</a> that <a href="/contribute/">contributed</a>
during the summer, all of these issues have been resolved,
which makes Comunica fully compliant to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL 1.1 Query</a> specification.</p>
<p>The next major goal will now be to implement the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/">SPARQL 1.1 Update</a> specification.</p>

<h2 id="property-paths">Property paths</h2>
<p>SPARQL 1.1 provides the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#propertypaths">property paths syntax</a>,
which is a power-user feature that allows complex paths between two resources to be expressed.
As of now, Comunica implements all property paths functionality according to the specification.</p>
<p>For example, property paths allow you to define alternative predicates:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-sparql">SELECT ?person WHERE {
  [ rdfs:label &quot;Bruce Willis&quot;@en ] (dbpedia-owl:spouse|dbpedia-owl:child) ?person.
}
</code></pre></pre>

<h2 id="csv-tsv-serializers">CSV/TSV Serializers</h2>
<p>While there already was support for many <a href="/docs/query/advanced/result_formats/">result formats</a> in Comunica,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/">CSV and TSV</a> support was missing.
As of this release, this lack has been resolved.
They can be used by requesting the <code>text/csv</code> or <code>text/tab-separated-values</code> media types.</p>
<p>For example, try it out as follows from the command line:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ comunica-sparql https://fragments.dbpedia.org/2016-04/en \
    &quot;SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100&quot; \
    -t &#x27;text/csv&#x27;
</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="basic-authentication">Basic authentication</h2>
<p>Sometimes, access to data on the Web requires <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</a>.
As of this release, you can <a href="/docs/query/advanced/basic_auth/">configure Comunica to pass the required credentials</a> to access these sources that require authentication.</p>
<p>For example, username and password can be passed from the command line:</p>
<pre><pre><code class="language-bash">$ comunica-sparql https://username:password@example.org/page \
    &quot;SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }&quot;
