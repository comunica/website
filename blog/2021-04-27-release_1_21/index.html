<h2 id="hypermedia-based-updates">Hypermedia-based updates</h2>
<p>A key feature of Comunica is its ability to <a href="/docs/modify/advanced/hypermedia/">automatically detect the type of source via hypermedia</a>,
and alter its query process based on the source&#x27;s capabilities.
With this new update, this hypermedia-based logic has also been added to the handling of update queries.</p>
<p>Concretely, if you pass a destination by URL to Comunica,
the capabilities of this destination will be detected,
and an appropriate destination handler will be used.</p>
<p>With this update, we provide support for <a href="/docs/query/advanced/destination_types/">a single hypermedia destination type</a>:
the <a href="https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-rdf-update-hypermedia-patch-sparql-update">SPARQL Update-based PATCH API</a>.
Such a destination is an HTTP APIs accepting PATCH requests containing SPARQL Update queries (<code>application/sparql-update</code>),
such as <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-rest.md#alternative-using-sparql-1">Solid servers</a>.</p>
<p>In future updates, we intend to support more types of hypermedia-based destinations as well,
such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-protocol-20130321/">SPARQL endpoints</a>,
and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>.</p>
